<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>In presenting some historical Memorials of the
Independent Churches in the County of Northampton,
it may be proper to take a glance at "the rise
and progress" of Nonconformity from the early days
of the Reformation.</p>

<p>When the Pope's supremacy was denied and some
change in the Church was sanctioned by Henry the
Eighth, there were a number of Protestants in England
who desired the reformation from Popery to be
carried further than was agreeable to the reigning
monarch and those that had the ascendancy in his
counsels. The reformers acknowledged "that corruptions
had been a thousand years introducing, which
could not be all discovered and thrown out at once";
and yet the ruling powers sought by "Acts of Uniformity"
to put a stop to all further improvement.</p>

<p>In the days of Queen Elizabeth, when the Protestant
exiles returned who had been driven to the Continent
by the persecutions in the reign of Mary, there was a
considerable increase in the number of ministers who
were dissatisfied with the reformation of the Anglican
Church. When the Act had passed, in the year 1559,
entitled "An Act for the Uniformity of Common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
Prayer and Service in the Church, and Administration
of the Sacraments," there were many ministers connected
with the Church who could never submit to
its requirements. They were men who pleaded for a
<i>purer</i> mode of worship and discipline than the authorities
would allow; and hence they were called <i>Puritans</i>.
They refused to wear the vestments, to read the
whole of the liturgical service, and to comply with
many of the ceremonial observances required; they
regarded them as relics of Popery, contrary to the
simplicity of the Gospel of Christ, and opposed to the
purity of his Church.</p>

<p>They suffered much during the reigns of Elizabeth
and the first two English Sovereigns of the Stuart
line. "The Star Chamber" and "the High Commission
Court" were established, before which they
were summoned, and where they were required to
answer questions proposed, that would have made
them their own accusers. If they refused to answer,
they were punished for contumacy; if they complied,
they were punished for Nonconformity.</p>

<p>To promote the reformation in the Church which
they desired, the Puritan ministers formed associations,
instituted classes, held meetings, and appointed
lectures, which they preached alternately at their different
Churches.</p>

<p>The County of Northampton was distinguished as
one of the strongholds of Puritanism. There were a
considerable number of Puritan divines in the Churches
in this County: here, the meetings of their associations
were frequently held; and here, in several of the towns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
their lectures were delivered; and though they had to
suffer much, yet they had some noble friends in the
County, who endeavoured to hold over them the shield
of their protection. These were the men who, by their
principles, their preaching, and their writings, were
the means of promoting evangelical truth and piety
in the country; and they were the men who preserved
the liberties of Englishmen, when they were in danger
of being trampled in the dust. While Hume, the
historian, treats their principles as frivolous and their
conduct as ridiculous, he bestows upon them this
high eulogium: "So absolute was the authority of the
Crown, that the precious spark of liberty had been
kindled and was preserved by the Puritans alone; and
it was to this sect that the English owe the whole
freedom of their constitution."</p>

<p>At the commencement of the reign of James I.,
when Bancroft was Archbishop of Canterbury, the
clergy were commanded to renew their subscription
to the requirements of the Church. More than seven
hundred of them refused; and in that number there
were fifty-seven non-subscribing ministers in Northamptonshire.</p>

<p>At a meeting of their Association, held in Northampton,
the ministers signed the following confession:
"That they believed the word of God contained in
the Old and New Testaments to be the perfect rule
of faith and manners; and that it ought to be read
and known by all people; and that the authority of it
exceeds all authority, not of the Pope only, but of the
Church also, and of councils, fathers, men, and angels."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>The liberty enjoyed in the days of the Commonwealth
many of them improved to the noblest purposes&mdash;prizing
the advantages they possessed, even
where they did not approve of the ruling powers.</p>

<p>At the restoration of the second Charles they hoped,
from the fair promises made by the King, that some
changes would have been made in their favour, so that
they might have ministered in the Church without
being required to violate the dictates of conscience;
but the enemies of further reformation gained the
ascendancy, and strove to drive from the Church the
Puritan divines: they succeeded in passing "the Act
of Uniformity" of 1662, which made the terms of conformity
so strait that more than two thousand ministers
were ejected by it, choosing rather to resign
their livings and all their worldly prospects, and to
cast themselves on the care of Providence, than submit
to what was required; for this Act demanded their
"unfeigned assent and consent to all and everything
contained in the Book of Common Prayer." It came
into operation August 24th, 1662, on Bartholomew-day&mdash;the
day when the massacre of the Protestants in
France took place ninety years before, hence called by
some "Black Bartholomew." It is stated, that this
day was chosen for this Act to take effect because the
Nonconforming ministers would then be deprived of
their year's income, which would be due shortly after.</p>

<p>The great Mr. Locke styles the ministers who refused
to conform, "learned, pious, orthodox divines."</p>

<p>It has been, we think, justly observed, "that ecclesiastical
history furnishes no such instance as this of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
a noble army of confessors at one time&mdash;it is an honour
peculiar to the English Dissenters. Never has the
world seen such a sacrifice to principle."</p>

<p>From this time the name of <i>Puritan</i> was exchanged
for that of <i>Nonconformist</i>.</p>

<p>These were the men that laid the foundation of a
large number of the Dissenting Churches which
remain to this day. In the County of Northampton
there were sixty ministers who were ejected by this
Act. Fourteen of this number afterwards conformed;
but of one of them it is remarked, "that he never
went up the pulpit stairs with comfort after he had
conformed&mdash;that he was at last but half a Conformist,
for which he was frequently cited into the Spiritual
Court: he freely suffered his children to go and hear
the ejected ministers, and always maintained a brotherly
affection towards them."</p>

<p>They were exposed to great trials, and suffered
much persecution, after their ejectment. To prevent
them from preaching, "The Conventicle Act" was
passed, forbidding more than five adult persons to
meet together for worship different from the forms of
the Church of England, on pain of very severe penalties.
After this came "The Five Mile Act," which
forbade them to reside within five miles of any corporate
town where they had formerly preached, or
from keeping school, or taking boarders, under a
penalty of forty pounds. Thus many were driven
from their families and their homes; and many were
heavily fined and repeatedly imprisoned. It was in
the midst of sufferings of this nature that several of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
the Churches were formed, the Memorials of which
are here presented.</p>

<p>When the glorious revolution by William the
Third was effected, a very pleasing change in their
circumstances took place. "The Act of Toleration"
that then passed was viewed by them as a great blessing.
Advancing knowledge on the principles of religious
liberty may have led us to see that such an Act
falls far short of that complete state of freedom to
which we should aspire; yet there was abundant
reason for our forefathers highly to value the liberty
it gave them, and they blessed the memory of him by
whom it was obtained. After the passing of this
Act, the term <i>Nonconformist</i> was exchanged for that
of <i>Dissenter</i>, as applied to those who availed themselves
of the advantages it gave. This is the name they now
bear, and which they will probably continue to bear
until the time when our civil rulers shall cease to
raise one denomination of Christians above another,
or to legislate for the Church of Christ.</p>

<p>A hundred and twenty years ago, Doddridge entered
upon his work as pastor and tutor at Northampton.
These offices he filled during twenty years; and he
evidently obtained, by his spirit, his preaching, his
writings, and his labours as a tutor, great influence
in the Churches in the County, which continued to be
felt many years after his death. A minister who was
ordained over one of these Churches forty years ago
observes, "It always appeared to me a pleasing fact,
as indicating the hold that Doddridge had obtained on
the hearts of the Northamptonshire Nonconformists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
that his hymns were almost everywhere in use in
conjunction with Watts, and in all the old books
used in my day the two were bound up together."</p>

<p>The following character of the Independent Churches
in this County is given by Job Orton, from the knowledge
he obtained of them while resident at Northampton,
first as student, afterwards as assistant, with
Doddridge, leaving him in the year 1742. Writing
to a young minister, he observes&mdash;"I am sorry you
have met with such poor encouragement, and especially
with any ill treatment, from the people in Northamptonshire.
I know them well: some of them are
narrow and bigoted, but in general they are serious
exemplary Christians, and the bulk of them are not
disposed to use a minister ill who is not imprudent,
and doth not directly oppose their favourite notions,
which is the only way to make people hold them the
faster. They are not disposed to censure a person
who preaches in a serious and experimental manner,
and in an evangelical strain, though he does not use
many of their favourite phrases, but will bear almost
anything from the pulpit where the main thing is not
wanting."</p>

<p>The idea of the present Work originated in a conversation
with the author of the Centenary Memorial
of Doddridge, at the Autumnal Meetings of the Congregational
Union, held at Northampton, 1851. If
the Writer could have prevailed on highly esteemed
brethren in the County to have undertaken the work,
he would gladly have done so; but the impression
which he had of its desirableness and adaptation for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
usefulness produced a conviction that the attempt
should be made. He has done what he could. The
loss of early records in some cases, and the entire
neglect to form them in others, has rendered the
accounts of some of the Churches very defective; but
in some cases the origin and history of the Churches
can be correctly traced.</p>

<p>Materials have been collected from all the sources
that supplied any, to which the Writer could have
access. His hope is, that the work will tend to serve
the cause of evangelical truth and piety, that it will
illustrate the nature and importance of Christian
Churches formed and sustained on the voluntary
principle, and that it may aid in some degree to
extend their influence and increase their efficiency.
He commends it to the candid attention of the reader,
and to the blessing of the Great Head of the Church.</p>

<p>Ashley, December 14th, 1852.</p>

<p>N. B. The Memorials commence with the Churches
in Northampton, and the other Churches in the
County are placed in chronological order, according
to the date of their formation, so far as that could
be ascertained.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>MEMORIALS OF THE INDEPENDENT CHURCHES IN
NORTHAMPTON.</h3>


<h4>SECTION 1.&mdash;INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT.</h4>

<p>Northampton has been distinguished in the history
of this country by the struggles there maintained for
the liberties of Englishmen; nor has it been unknown
in the efforts that have been made to secure the liberty
of Christian worship and the purity of divine institutions.</p>

<p>Soon after that "morning star of the Reformation,"
John Wickliffe, appeared, about the year 1369, his
doctrines were introduced into Northampton, and met
with much favour in the town. Notwithstanding the
earnest opposition of the clergy, they were cherished
by several persons of rank, the Mayor himself being
tainted with the heresy. A formal complaint was made
to the King in council by one Richard Stannisworth,
a woolstapler, that the chief magistrate, John Fox,
harboured in his house James Collyn, a fierce maintainer
of Lollardy (as the sentiments of Wickliffe were
called), in Northampton, and that they encouraged the
preaching of the Lollards, contrary to the prohibition
of the Bishop of Lincoln. Thus it appears that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
were numbers at that time in Northampton ready to
welcome the days of reformation from the corruptions
of Popery.</p>

<p>When the Reformation was introduced, and sanctioned
by the rulers of England, amongst those who
sought a greater degree of purity in the worship of
God than the sovereign would allow, and who could
not conform to the relics of Romanism that were
retained, were several devoted men who laboured and
suffered in Northampton.</p>

<p>Francis Merbury was a minister at Northampton
during this period, when the Puritans struggled to
obtain a change in the existing state of things. He
was brought into many troubles for Nonconformity,
being several times cast into prison. On Nov. 5th,
1578, he was convened before the High Commission,
where he underwent a severe examination, and was
sent a prisoner to the Marshalsea.</p>

<p>Edward Snape, after being educated in the University
of Cambridge, became minister of Saint Peter's
Church, Northampton. He was a decided Nonconformist,
a laborious preacher, and a zealous advocate
for a pure reformation of the Church. It is stated that
when the parishioners of St. Peter's understood that
he did not account himself a full minister until he
should be chosen by some particular congregation, they
immediately chose him to be their minister. In 1590
he was brought into trouble on account of the Associations
held in Northamptonshire and Warwickshire.
He was a zealous and active member of these assemblies,
for which he was summoned before the High
Commission. He moved the Mayor of Northampton
to unite with other towns in presenting a supplication
to the Queen, humbly beseeching her Majesty to hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
their cries, and grant them a more pure ecclesiastical
discipline.</p>

<p>The following anecdote is related of this persecuted
servant of God: "He was cast into prison by the
bishops for his Nonconformity; and all his money
being expended by his long confinement, he met with
much unkind usage from the gaoler. The good man
being one day on his knees in fervent prayer to God,
and the window of his chamber being open, he observed
something thrown into the room; but he resolved to
finish his prayer before he examined what it was.
When he rose from his knees, he found to his great
surprise that it was a purse full of gold. By this
unexpected supply he was more comfortable in his
situation, and enabled to make his keeper more humane
ever after. "The Lord heareth the young ravens that
cry; how much more," it is observed, in connexion
with this, "will he hear his afflicted people?"</p>

<p>Humphrey Fenn was several years minister at
Northampton&mdash;a most learned and venerable divine,
whose ministry was rendered very successful: yet he
underwent many troubles for Nonconformity. While
at Northampton he experienced the cruel oppression of
the times&mdash;was apprehended and committed to close
prison, where he remained a long time. During his
confinement the inhabitants of Northampton presented
a supplication to Queen Elizabeth, humbly and earnestly
desiring her Majesty to grant his release, and
his restoration to his beloved ministry. In this supplication
they affirmed, upon their dutiful allegiance, that
during his abode in that place he had lived a honest
and a peaceable life; and they gave a high character of
his diligence in preaching, his obedience to God, and
to those in authority. It does not appear whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
this application was at all successful. Mr. Fenn, with
some others, presented a long letter to the Queen in
vindication of their own innocency; but we have not
discovered how long they remained in prison after
that period.</p>

<p>John Penry, a very distinguished Puritan, after
leaving the University, was settled for some time at
Northampton. He was brought before the High Commissioners
for Nonconformity, and after examination,
cast into prison. After a month's confinement, he was
discharged; but when he had obtained his release, they
sent their pursuivants to apprehend him, and again
commit him to prison. Walton, one of them, went
immediately to Northampton, and upon entering Mr.
Penry's house ransacked his study, and took away
all the books and papers which he thought proper;
but Mr. Penry was not to be found. Upon the publication
of 'Martin Mar-Prelate,' he was again apprehended.</p>

<p>He became at length a member of a Church of
Brownists, meeting about London, sometimes in the
fields and woods, in the dead of the night, to avoid the
fury of the prelates. During his imprisonment he
wrote a most pious, affectionate, and encouraging letter
to Mr. F. Johnson, the pastor, and the rest of the
brethren. It is addressed "to the distressed and faithful
congregation of Christ in London, and all the
members thereof, whether in bonds or at liberty;" and
he concludes by subscribing himself, "their loving
brother in the patience and sufferings of the Gospel,
John Penry, a witness of Christ in this life, and a
partaker of the glory that shall be revealed." He at
length lost his life for the cause to which he was
devoted, for he was executed May 29th, 1593.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Arthur Wake was another of these worthies, who
had some connexion with Northampton. He was a
son of John Wake, Esq., descended from an ancient
and honourable family. He became a most popular
and useful preacher. In 1565 he was presented to the
living of Great Billing, in Northamptonshire. He was
very much persecuted for his Nonconformity, and at
length deprived of his living. In the year 1593 he
was residing at Northampton, and engaged as minister
of Saint John's Hospital in this town. It is stated
that "he was a divine of good learning, great piety,
and a zealous, laborious, and useful preacher."</p>

<p>By the rigorous proceedings of the ruling prelates
the Church was deprived of many of its brightest ornaments,
and nearly all its faithful pastors were ejected,
especially in Northamptonshire. In the vicinity of
Northampton there was William Fleshurne, or Fletcher,
B.D., rector of Abington, in 1588. Of him it is
recorded, that in 1590 he was one of the Puritan
ministers who associated in general synods and particular
classes at Northampton, Fawsley, and other
places, to promote the new discipline in opposition to
the Established Church. He obtained the vicarage
of Moulton in 1607, and held it till his death; but
appears to have resided at Abington, where he was
buried the 3rd of May, 1627.</p>

<p>Dr. John Preston was born at Heyford, in Northamptonshire,
in the parish of Bugbrook, 1578. He
became a very popular preacher, but met with considerable
opposition on account of his Puritan principles.
He had a strong constitution, which he wore
out in the study and in the pulpit. Being desirous of
dying in his native county and among his old friends,
he retired into Northamptonshire, where he departed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
this life in a most pious and devout manner in the 41st
year of his age, and was buried in Fawsley Church,
old Mr. Dod, minister of the place, preaching his
funeral sermon to a numerous auditory. His practical
works and sermons were printed by his own order
after his decease.</p>

<p>William Prandlove was a respectable Puritan
minister, who about the year 1562 became vicar of
Fawsley, in Northamptonshire, and in 1577 he became
rector of Lamport, in the same county. He united
with his brethren in their private associations, and
took an active part in promoting the desired ecclesiastical
discipline, for which, in the year 1590, he
was apprehended and cast into prison, where he remained
a long time. He was after carried before
the High Commission and the Star Chamber, where
he underwent the severe scrutiny of his ecclesiastical
inquisitors.</p>

<p>In connexion with these statements relating to
Puritan ministers who maintained and suffered for
their principles in the county town of Northamptonshire
and its immediate vicinity, it may not be considered
unsuitable to state that a Sir Richard Knightley,
at Fawsley in this county, who received the honour
of knighthood from the Earl of Leicester, at Fotheringay,
in the 8th of Elizabeth, 1566, was one of the
earliest and most zealous patrons of the Puritans, or
opposers of the new Act for the Uniformity of Worship,
who assumed the importance of an organized party in
1568. Their publications, principally from the pen of
John Ap-Henry, better known by the assumed name
of Martin Mar-Prelate, were industriously though
secretly disseminated by means of a travelling printing
press, conducted by one Walgrave. To elude detection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the scene of its operations was frequently changed. It
was first set up at Mousley, in Surrey, from whence it
was removed to Fawsley, and worked in a private
upper room, approached only by a winding staircase.
Its next stage was to Norton, another of Sir Richard's
seats. It was subsequently conveyed to Coventry,
Woolston, in Warwickshire, and finally to Manchester,
where it was seized by the Earl of Derby. For these
clandestine proceedings Sir Richard and his associates
were summoned before the Court of Star Chamber, and
heavily fined; but Archbishop Whitgift, though one of
the most prominent objects of their attack, with a truly
Christian spirit obtained by his intercession a remission
of their sentence. In the succeeding reign, Sir Richard
ventured, with Sir Edward Montague, Sir Francis
Hastings, and 60 or 80 other gentlemen, to petition the
King on behalf of the Puritan clergy of this county;
but they were severely rebuked in the Star Chamber
and at the Council Table for their presumption, and
Sir Richard was dismissed both from the lieutenancy
and the commission of the peace.</p>

<p>There is another name that is connected with
Fawsley and the county of Northampton, to which we
should like to devote a single page&mdash;the name of John
Dod, A.M., generally styled "the Decalogist," from
his celebrated exposition of the Ten Commandments.
He resided several years at Fawsley, under the patronage
of the Knightley family. This learned Puritan
divine was the youngest son of John Dod, Esq., of
Shacklach, in Cheshire, where he was born in 1555.
He was educated at Jesus College, Cambridge. He
was successively minister of Hanwell, in Oxfordshire,
Fenny Drayton, in Leicestershire, Canons Ashby and
Fawsley in this county. In a work published in 1635,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
entitled 'A Plain and Familiar Exposition of the Lord's
Prayer,' there is a dedication to his much honoured,
loving friend, Mr. Richard Knightley; where he states,
"I dedicate this book unto you, that as the Lord is my
witness that I pray daily for you by name (and so, by
his assistance, I purpose to do while I live), so I must
leave some testimony behind me to men after my death
(which I continually wait for) of my unfeigned and
hearty thankfulness for all your favours and goodness
to me and mine." He survived ten years after this,
and died at the very advanced age of 90 years&mdash;was
buried at Fawsley, 19th of August, 1645. He published
a number of different works; but his sayings
acquired great provincial celebrity, and have been
printed in various forms. Fuller characterizes him
as "by nature a witty, by industry a learned, by grace
a godly, divine." His life was written by Samuel
Clarke.</p>

<p>Mr. Dod was several times silenced for his want of
entire conformity to the established system; but he
maintained his principles to the last, being distinguished
by his fervent spirit of devotion, his entire reliance on
God, his submission to the Divine will, his trust in the
Redeemer, his heavenly-mindedness. "The righteous
shall be had in everlasting remembrance."</p>

<p>Though this Work chiefly relates to one denomination
of Nonconformists in Northamptonshire, it appeared to
us desirable to include a short notice of these early
advocates of Nonconformity, especially in the town of
Northampton, though they did not generally come out
from the Church as by law established; for they
laboured to obtain a further reformation, and would
rather suffer than conform to all that was required.
Their principles and their spirit gradually led on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
all that has since been manifested in the support of
genuine, evangelical, vital, voluntary Christianity, in
the different communities that have separated from the
Established Church.</p>


<h4>SECTION 2.&mdash;THE CHURCH AT CASTLE HILL.</h4>

<p>There are some places of worship which attain
notoriety entirely from some celebrated individual that
has been connected with them. The talents, the learning,
the preaching, or the writings of one of the ministers,
have identified the place with his name.</p>

<p>This is the case with the Meeting House at Castle
Hill, Northampton. A plain structure, resembling
many others that were built about the same period,
it is regarded with the deepest interest, as the place
where Doddridge spent the greater part of his life as
a pastor. In that place Doddridge laboured; there
stands the pulpit in which Doddridge preached; to
that vestry Doddridge retired; there he often watched
and prayed; at that table he oft presented the memorials
of a Saviour's love, and poured forth from the
fulness of an affectionate, fervent heart, the strains of
an exalted faith and piety.</p>

<p>No certain record can be found of the first formation
of the Church assembling in this place. Its origin
is lost in obscurity. When the "Act of Uniformity"
passed, Mr. Jeremiah Lewis, rector of Saint Giles's,
Northampton, was ejected from his living; but such
was his natural reserve, and such his retired habits,
that it does not appear that he ever preached after
his ejectment. He did not long survive that event.
"He was a man of great meekness; remarkable for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
his prudence; much beloved by the neighbouring
ministers."</p>

<p>Mr. Samuel Blower, who was ejected from Woodstock,
in Oxfordshire, is recorded as the first pastor of
this Church. Of his history but little is known. He
was educated at Oxford, and was a Fellow of Magdalen
College. Of his general character we are informed,
"that he was of a meek temper, peaceable
principles, and a godly life;" of his sentiments, that
"he had very exalted thoughts of divine grace and
redeeming love;" of the prevailing spirit of his ministry,
"that he discovered a very tender regard to
young persons, and would often address himself very
affectionately to them, not only in his sermons, but in
his visits; and that he rejoiced much when he saw
anything hopeful in their characters:" of his method of
preaching, that "he affected not a pompous way; nor
did he dispense the truths of the Gospel with the
wisdom of man's words, knowing that that was not so
likely to be attended with a divine blessing&mdash;Scripture
revelations, in Scripture language, were the main subjects
of his discourses:" of his friendships we are told
that "he was a most desirable friend, being free and
communicative, candid in the last degree, of a very
sympathizing spirit with those in affliction, and particularly
mindful of them in his prayers; and he was
so firm and constant where he professed friendship,
that it must be some very ill thing indeed that was the
occasion of his breaking it off." Of his devoted piety
it is said, "that wherever he had an interest, he was
for improving it for God to his utmost, and took every
opportunity to do so."</p>

<p>He published a funeral sermon for Mrs. Elizabeth
Tub, from Psalm xviii. 46: "The Lord liveth, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
blessed be my rock," &amp;c. Mr. Blower afterwards removed
to Abingdon, in Berks, where he died in 1701.</p>

<p>The records of this Church commence with the following
statement:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><div class="hanging"><i>Acts and Memoirs of the particular Church of Christ at
Northampton, of which Mr. Samuel Blower was pastor.</i></div>

<p>In the year 1695, this Church did, upon the departure of
the Rev. Mr. Blower, their pastor, give their unanimous call
to Thomas Shepherd to succeed him in the pastoral office,
who thereupon accepting the call, did actually succeed him
in the office aforesaid.</p></blockquote>

<p>The form of the Church Covenant:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>We, this Church of Christ, whose names are underwritten,
having given up, ourselves to the Lord and one to another
according to the will of God, do promise and covenant, in the
presence of God, to walk together in all the laws and ordinances
of Christ, according to the rules of his Gospel, through
Jesus Christ so strengthening us. (This was subscribed by
about 164 names.)</p></blockquote>

<p>A memorandum on the next page states, "That
Thomas Shepherd, accepting the call this Church gave
him, did own and declare his willingness and consent
to walk with them as a pastor with his people, so long
as they could walk comfortably together in all the ways
and ordinances of the Lord."</p>

<p>Under date of September 11th, 1696, we have the
following statement, from which it appears that Mr.
Shepherd's ministry at Northampton was of short
duration:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>At a Church-meeting then holden, it was publicly owned
by this Church that Thomas Shepherd, their present pastor,
was not under obligation to a continuance with them, by
virtue of any conditional consent or promise made upon sitting
down. The conditions not being observed by this people,
my engagements to them thereupon must needs cease.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>About a year and a half from this time, <i>i.e.</i>, February
25th, 1698, Mr. John Hunt was chosen the
pastor of this Church. His father was one of the
ejected ministers, a Mr. William Hunt, ejected from
the vicarage of Sutton, in Cambridgeshire. He was
a man of eminent piety and great usefulness, and
two of his sons became devoted ministers among the
Dissenters. The pastor of this Church was first at
Royston, and from thence came to Northampton, and
afterwards he became minister of the Independent
Church at Newport Pagnell. He appears to have
inserted the following passage from Philip Henry's
'Life' among the Church records:&mdash;"Those ministers
who will rule by love and meekness need no laws or
canons to rule by, other than those of the holy Scriptures."</p>

<p>He was a man of considerable talent, and wrote
several valuable works. There appear to have been
100 members admitted to the Church during the ministry
of Mr. Hunt; that ministry closed at Northampton
in 1709. He died at Tunstead, in Norfolk, in
1730. On February 22nd, 1709, after divers repeated
calls, and days and times of seeking God, Rev. Thomas
Tingey gave his acceptance of the call of this people,
together with the reason of it, and was solemnly
ordained unto the pastoral office and charge of this
Church of Christ&mdash;Mr. Dowley, of Lutterworth, Mr.
King, of Wellingborough, Mr. Some, of Harborough,
Mr. Norris, of Welford, Mr. Ironmonger, of Buckingham,
Mr. Jackson, of Buckby, Mr. Mason, of Spaldwich,
and Mr. Wills, about to be settled at Kettering,
and Mr. Dale, of Creaton, being present.</p>

<p>Mr. Tingey had previously been minister at Newport
Pagnell, so that Mr. Hunt's removal was an exchange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of situations with him. Mr. Tingey was an evangelical
and able minister, and very zealously exerted himself,
even beyond his strength, to preach the Gospel in destitute
towns and villages around. On leaving Northampton
he became pastor of an Independent Church
in Fetter Lane. Dr. Ridgley preached his funeral
sermon, and published it, in which he gives him a
high character as an able and successful minister. He
died November 1st, 1729, a few weeks after his settlement
in London.</p>

<p>The ministry of Mr. Tingey appears to have continued
about twenty years, until the first part of the
year 1729, for on September 28th of that year we
find the first invitation given to Doddridge, with a
view to the pastoral office.</p>

<p>As we have a more full account of this pastorate
than of any other over the Church at Castle Hill, and
as it is invested with some peculiar interest from the
labours of Doddridge, so we think it proper to present
the particulars to some extent before the reader. The
following is a copy of the invitation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><div class="center"><i>From the Dissenting Congregation at Castle Hill,<br />
Northampton.</i></div>

<p>The Church of Christ in Northampton sendeth greeting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reverend Sir</span>,&mdash;The dispensations of God's providence
towards us in suffering the removal of our late pastor is very
awful, and we hope hath lain with weight upon our hearts.
It hath urged us to make prayer and supplication that God,
the Great Shepherd, would appear and direct us in this difficult
and weighty matter, and send among us one whom he
will eminently own and make a great blessing unto us.</p>

<p>Sir, we have had some taste of your ministerial ability in
your occasional labours amongst us, which have given a general
satisfaction to the congregation; but this matter being
so important, we humbly apply ourselves to you, that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
would come and preach among us as a candidate for a month.
We leave our brethren, who will bring this, to use what
further arguments they may think meet, and recommend you
to the wisdom and conduct of the divine Spirit, and continue
our prayers and supplications to the great God for our direction.
We subscribe our names by the order and consent of
the whole Church. (Signed by ten persons.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The prospect of this removal to Northampton became
a matter of great concern to Doddridge and his
friends. He had recently commenced his academy
at Harborough; he was engaged as assistant to Mr.
Some; the latter was very unwilling for him to entertain
the idea of removing at this time; and from
his representations, and the regard Doddridge had for
his friendship, with some other circumstances, he had
almost arrived at a determined refusal. But in the
Church at Northampton there was much concern
about the matter, and they did all in their power to
obtain a compliance; and it was as if God worked
with them. They made such representations to the
ministers who were likely to have influence with Doddridge,
as to engage them on their side. Mr. Clarke,
of St. Alban's, wrote, October 21st, 1729&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your resolution with respect to Northampton
I could not but approve, according to the view I then had of
the matter; but to-day Mr. Bliss, of that town, called upon
me with a letter from the Church, in which they represent
how unanimously and earnestly they desired your settlement
among them, and how ready they should be in every particular
to make the removal agreeable to you; and that as to
the objection from your attendance upon your pupils, they
would gladly accept of what time you could spare without
any damage to them, as they are sensible that you have abilities
to go through with both employments. They further
urged, that should you refuse their invitation, it might expose
them to the danger of division, and they could not join unanimously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
in any other call. Mr. Bliss also told me that they
could have a house fit for your academy on easy terms, and
that they would furnish some of the rooms for you at their
own expense; and that if Mrs. Jennings did not think fit to
remove her family, and is out of pocket by having provided
for the reception of your pupils, they would make her a handsome
present to reimburse her. In short, that the people
were so set upon having you on any terms, that they would
do anything for you in their power, and earnestly desired me
to press you to consent.</p>

<p>I must own, their very great zeal in this matter weighs
very much with me; and the more so, because it would give
you the prospect of being of great service there, and by that
means in all that county, where you might be an instrument
of promoting a more catholic spirit, as well as of bringing
in souls to Christ. I am ready to think that God has some
special work for you to do there.</p></blockquote>

<p>And Mr. Some, the most decided and earnest opponent
of the change, goes to Northampton to converse
with the people about the matter, intending to prevail
on them to give it up; and he, in writing to Doddridge,
says, "The hearts of the people are moved altogether
as the trees of a wood when bent by the wind; and
they are under such strong impressions about your
coming to them, that it is impossible for a man to converse
with them without feeling something for them.
The mention of your name diffuses life and spirit
through the whole body, and nothing can be heard
of but Mr. Doddridge. I find myself in the utmost
perplexity, and know not what to say or do. I think
I am like <i>Saul among the prophets</i>; and that the same
spirit which is in the people begins to seize me also."</p>

<p>Still, before his removal from Harborough, he undergoes
a great struggle. He had almost decided, notwithstanding
all this, to remain there; went to Northampton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to "lay down his good friends there as gently
as he could"; preached to them with this view from
"When he could not be persuaded, we ceased, saying,
The will of the Lord be done." He thinks much of
the weight of business that would lie upon him as
tutor and pastor; of his own youth; the largeness of
the congregation, and having no prospect of an assistant.
But he is passing through a room of the house
where he lodges, and hears a child reading a chapter
in the Bible to its mother;&mdash;the only words he distinctly
catches are, "As thy day so shall thy strength
be." This deeply impressed him, yet he persisted in his
refusal. Then a deacon of the Church, whose father
was ill, presents an urgent request for him to improve
his father's death when he is taken away. He dies
that night. Doddridge is detained by his promise for
the funeral. He is greatly assisted; many attend, and
express the greatest satisfaction in his labours. While
waiting for this funeral the young people come to him
in a body, and entreat his continuance, promising to
submit to every method of instruction he might propose.
At length he is so overcome as to be convinced
that it is his duty to accept the invitation, though still
directly contrary to the advice and wishes of his
friends; yet, seeing the hand of God in it, he breaks
through all other restraints. After much earnest
prayer, correspondence, and consultations, Doddridge
sends his answer to the invitation to the pastoral
office, of which the following is a copy:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><div class="center"><i>To the Congregation at Northampton, on my acceptance of<br />
their Invitation to undertake the Pastoral Charge.</i></div>

<div class="signature"><i>December 6th, 1729.</i></div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friends</span>,&mdash;After a serious and impartial consideration
of your case, and repeated addresses to the Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Father of Light for his guidance and direction, I can at
length assure you that I am determined by his permission to
accept of your kind invitation, and undertake the pastoral
care of you, with the most ardent feelings of sincere gratitude
and affection.</p>

<p>You will easily apprehend that I could not form this resolution
without a great deal of anguish, both with regard to
those friends whom I am called upon to resign, and in reference
to that great and difficult work that lies before me, in
the care of your large congregation and my academy. But I
hope that I have sincerely devoted my soul to God and my
Redeemer; and therefore I would humbly yield myself up to
what, in present circumstances, I apprehend to be his will.
I take this important step with fear and trembling, yet with
a humble confidence in him, and with the hope that in the
midst of these great difficulties he will not leave me entirely
destitute of that <i>presence</i> which I desire to prefer to everything
which life can bestow.</p>

<p>As for you, my brethren, let me entreat of you, that "if
there be any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if
any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels of mercy, fulfil ye
my joy." Let me beseech you to remember, that by accepting
your call I have entrusted the happiness of my life into your
hands. Prepare yourselves, therefore, to cover my many infirmities
with the mantle of your love, and continue to treat
me with the same kindness and gentleness as those dear and
excellent friends have done whom I am now about to leave
in compassion to your souls; for God knows that no temporal
advantage you could have offered would have engaged me to
relinquish them.</p>

<p>May my heavenly Father comfort my heart in what is now
determined, by giving an abundant success to my ministrations
among you, so that a multitude of souls may have
reason to praise him on that account! and let me beg that
you will bear me daily on your hearts before his throne in
prayer, and seek for me that extraordinary assistance without
which I must infallibly sink under the great work I have thus
undertaken.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>I shall continue to recommend you, my dearly beloved, to
the grace of Almighty God, the great Shepherd of his sheep,
with that affection which now so peculiarly becomes your
most devoted friend and servant, in the bonds of our common
Lord,</p>

<p>The account of the ordination we present, as inserted
by Doddridge in the records of the Church:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>After repeated solicitations, long deliberation, and earnest
prayer to God for direction, I came to the resolution to accept
the invitation of my dear and most affectionate friends at
Northampton on Saturday, December 6th, 1729, and certified
the Church of that resolution by a letter that evening. I
removed from Harborough and came to settle here on Wednesday,
December 24th. On Thursday, March 19th, 1730, I
was solemnly set apart to the pastoral office by prayer, and
fasting, and imposition of hands. Mr. Goodrich began with
prayer and reading Eph. iv.; Mr. Dawson prayed; then Mr.
Watson preached from 1 Tim. iii. 1, "If a man desire the
office of a bishop, he desireth a good work." Mr. Norris then
read the call of the Church, of which I declared my acceptance;
he took my confessions of faith and ordination vows,
and then proceeded to set me apart by prayer. Immediately
afterwards, Mr. Clarke, of St. Alban's, gave the charge to
me; and Mr. Saunders, of Kettering, the exhortation to the
people; and Mr. Mattock concluded the whole solemnity by
prayer.</p>

<p>It was a delightful, and I hope it will prove a very profitable,
day. I write this memoranda of it under the remembrance
of a painful and threatening illness, which detained
me from my public work the two ensuing Sabbaths. The
event is still dubious; but I leave my life and my dear flock
in the hand of the great Shepherd, hoping what passed on my
ordination-day will be an engagement to me to live more usefully,
or an encouragement to die more cheerfully, than I
should otherwise have done. Amen.</p>

<p>I administered the Lord's Supper, for the first time, on
Lord's-day, April 12th, 1730. I hope we had much of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
presence of God with us, and may regard it as a token for good.
On the 4th of February it pleased God to add to us eight
persons, in whose character and experience we find great
reason to be fully satisfied.</p></blockquote>

<p>The number of names entered in the Church-book,
as we consider by the hand of Doddridge, is 342.</p>

<p>After about ten years' labour as pastor, tutor, and
author, finding the state of the Church not to his satisfaction,
and feeling that he could not attend to it as it
appeared to him to require, he endeavoured to engage
the Church to choose some assistants to him in his
work among the people, under the name of elders.
They acceded to the request of their pastor, and unanimously
made choice of the Rev. Job Orton, Rev. John
Evans, as also of Mr. John Brown, to assist the pastor
in his care of the society; and also desired Mr. Samuel
Heyworth, by divine providence resident among them,
though a member of the Church at Rowell, to assist,
by his counsels and labours, in the same office. They
were solemnly recommended to God by prayer at a
Church-meeting, February 26, 1740, having then signified
their acceptance of the call.</p>

<p>These elders appeared at once to enter with an
earnest spirit on the duties of their office. After
several meetings amongst themselves, with the concurrence
of the pastor and deacons they drew up a
letter, to be presented to the Church, expressive of
what they considered to be the duties to which they
were called, and of what they regarded as necessary to
the good order and prosperity of the society. The
letter was gratefully received by the Church. Special
Church-meetings were appointed to consider the proposals
it contained, and the unanimous sanction of the
members present was given to what the elders desired.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Regarding the letter as an interesting document, we
shall here present it before the reader:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><div class="hanging"><i>The Elders and Deacons of the Church of Christ assembling
on Castle Hill, Northampton, to their brethren of the
Church, greeting.</i></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Brethren, beloved in the Lord</span>,&mdash;As we are
chosen, in common with our pastor, to watch over you, and
serve among you in offices relating to the public honour, edification,
and comfort of the society, we think it our duty to
address ourselves to you with one consent, on a subject which
appears to us of great importance.</p>

<p>You cannot but know, dear brethren, that our Lord Jesus
Christ, whose servants we are, has by his apostles commanded
his Churches that they "withdraw themselves from every brother
who walketh disorderly, and not according to the traditions
received from them; that they mark those that cause scandals
among them; and that if any obey not the word, that they
note that man, and have no fellowship with him, that he may
be ashamed; and that if any brother be a fornicator, or
covetous, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner" (and,
upon the same principle, if he be a liar, or one that defrauds
others), "they should not eat with such a one; but that"
(though such as are without are to be referred to the judgment
of God) "they judge those that are within, and put
away from among themselves such wicked persons." These,
brethren, are the precepts of Christ, according to which, by
our entering into Church fellowship, we engaged to walk;
and we apprehend that the neglect of these precepts, and the
discipline in the Church of Christ which should be founded
upon them, is a great evil, which often provokes God to withdraw
from his people, and to hinder the success of other
ordinances while this is neglected. We do therefore, in
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, beseech you that ye
would attend to these precepts, and would consent to proper
measures for the regular exercise of discipline among us.
And as we have observed that several have withdrawn themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
from the table of the Lord, though their names stand
as members among us, we desire that the Church would take
it into consideration, and that if it shall be found (as they
fear it will) that some have withdrawn on account of such
irregularities in their behaviour as have given scandal and
offence, we cannot think the matter ought to rest merely in
their withdrawing from us, but that it is our duty as a Church
solemnly to admonish them, and, where the offence has been
great and public, to separate them from our communion, till
God shall give them repentance to the acknowledgment of
their sin; after which, it is our undoubted duty, on a suitable
time of trial, with proper declarations of their repentance, to
admit them again in the spirit of love and rejoicing in their
recovery.</p>

<p>We do therefore, in concurrence with our pastor, by whose
approbation we write these things, exhort you, in the name of
our Lord Jesus Christ, that you enter into a serious disquisition
of these things; and advise, that you appoint a day in
which they may be solemnly discussed, at which the members
of the Church shall be present, and such only; at which
time we, the elders, are ready to exhibit a list of several
persons absenting themselves from communion, of whose
cases the Church will do well to judge, that such measures
may be taken concerning them as the precepts of our common
Lord direct; and we desire that the elders may now be commissioned,
in the name of the Church, to give notice to such
persons, if they think proper to attend at that meeting, that
if they have anything to offer in favour of themselves and their
own conduct, they may be heard, and all due regard be paid
to their defence; they being also in the name of the Church
informed, that if they do not so attend, their absenting themselves
without sufficient reason assigned will be taken as a
confession of their being incapable of offering any excuse, so
that the Church will accordingly proceed against them.</p>

<p>To this, as our unanimous advice to the Church, we have
here set our hands, that if any of us then should be absent,
our approbation of these measures may be evidently declared;
and we pray that God may guide you in all your deliberations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and resolutions, to the glory of his name, and the honour and
edification of this Society.</p>

<p><i>April 2nd, 1741.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>After this follows a number of cases presented to
the Church for suitable admonition and discipline.
One entry we will quote, as deserving the attention of
the Churches of Christ at the present day:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>It is the unanimous judgment of this Church, that the frequent
acts of bankruptcy which have happened in Dissenting
congregations, as well as elsewhere, have brought so great a
dishonour on religion, and occasioned so much mischief and
reproach, that we think ourselves obliged in duty to enter our
public protest and caution on this head; and we do hereby
declare, that if any persons in stated communion with us shall
become a bankrupt, or, as it is commonly expressed, fail in
the world, he must expect to be cut off from our body, unless
he do within two months give to the Church, by the elders,
either in word or writing, such an account of his affairs as
shall convince us that his fall was owing not to his own sin
and folly, but to the afflicting hand of God upon him; in
which case, far from adding affliction to the afflicted, we hope
that as God shall enable us we shall be ready to vindicate,
comfort, and assist him, as his friends and brethren in Christ.</p>

<p>Signed, in the name and presence of the Church, this 1st
day of May, 1741, by the pastor and deacons.</p></blockquote>

<p>Shortly after this Doddridge is deprived of his
valuable assistant in the academy and the Church,
Job Orton; and he parts with him in a manner that
indicates the high sense he entertained of his worth,
and the affectionate attachment he felt to him. When
it was decided for him to leave, we find this record:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Our dear and reverend brother, Mr. Job Orton, having declared
his purpose of leaving us, on the invitation of the
united Church at Shrewsbury, was solemnly recommended to
God by the prayers of the Church, several hours being spent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
in that exercise, and then was dismissed to the said Church
at Shrewsbury by the following letter, sent by the pastor, in
the name of the Church:&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<div class="hanging">"<i>The Church of Christ assembling on Castle Hill, Northampton,
to the Church of Christ in Salop assembling</i>.</div>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Brethren and Friends, beloved in the Lord</span>,&mdash;
As the providence of God hath seen fit to remove from us to
you our reverend and dear brother, Mr. Job Orton, who has for
many years resided amongst us, and has of late years, with
great honour and acceptance, ministered unto us and assisted
us under the office of an elder; though we cannot resign him
without the most affectionate and tender concern and deep
regret, yet, being obliged to acquiesce in the determination
of the great Head of the Church, though to us a very painful
one, we think it our duty by these letters to dismiss him
from our stated communion to yours; which accordingly we
hereby do, blessing God for all the advantages we have enjoyed
by his ministry and presence, and earnestly praying
that his labours may not only be highly acceptable and delightful
to you, as we are persuaded they must be, but that
they may be crowned with abundant success. We cannot doubt
but your conduct to him will be so obliging and affectionate,
as abundantly to demonstrate the sense you have of the singular
favour of Providence to you in sending among you so able,
so faithful, and so zealous a labourer; and we earnestly desire
your prayers for us, that God may make up to us, by his immediate
presence and blessing, the unspeakable and otherwise
irreparable loss which we sustain by his removal from us.</p>

<p>"Signed, by the unanimous direction of the Church, at their
Church-meeting, October 1st, 1741, in the name of the whole
society,</p>

<div class="signature">"<span class="smcap">Philip Doddridge.</span>"</div></blockquote>

<p>Another memoranda by Doddridge we shall here
insert:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><div class="signature"><i>May 2nd, 1748.</i></div>

<p>I reviewed the list of the Church from the beginning, and
found that from 1694, when Mr. Hunt was settled as their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
pastor (that is, within the compass of 54 years), 784 members
have been admitted, inclusive of those then found&mdash;that
is, one year with another, more than 14 members each year:
of which 240 only continue alive and reside still among us;
of which, 58 were admitted before my settlement with the
Church;&mdash;and, as I have admitted 299, they show that 117,
who have been admitted from that time, are either removed
or dead, besides many others who were admitted before.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;Seventy-eight have been my pupils.</p></blockquote>

<p>This would average, during the ministry of Doddridge,
16 admissions in a year.</p>

<p>The following letter of Doddridge, written about
this period, containing some statements relating to his
Church and his feelings as a pastor, we think never before
published, may here be suitably introduced. It
was addressed to "the Rev. Mr. Ryland, in Warwick,"
father of the late Dr. Ryland, of Bristol, and afterwards
minister of College Street Chapel, Northampton.</p>


<blockquote><div class="signature"><i>Northampton, May 17th, 1747.</i></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. and dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am much obliged to you for your
affectionate letter, and shall be very ready to give you a visit
and a sermon, if Providence give me a convenient opportunity;
but my motions are at present uncertain, depending
partly on some visits I expect from my friends, and partly
upon other circumstances. Be assured, Sir, that if I have an
opportunity I shall be very glad to see you and serve you to
the best of my little power, and think myself happy in an
opportunity of doing anything to promote the kingdom of
Christ amongst you or elsewhere. I beg your prayers for me.
Through the Divine goodness I continue well. I have been
much afflicted by the breach made in our Church by the
Moravians, who have got from us a little congregation. The
affliction has been increased by the death of some very promising
and hopeful persons, especially of one who died last
night, and whose age, circumstances, and character concurred
to give us the greatest hopes of usefulness from him; so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
it is one of the greatest blows of that kind that I have received
since I came hither. My spirits are much grieved
and oppressed; pray that I may be enabled to wait on the
Lord with quiet submission and humble hope.</p>

<p>We congratulate you on your marriage, and heartily recommend
you and Mrs. Ryland to the Divine blessing.</p>

<div class="center">I am, Rev. and dear Sir,</div>
<div class="signature">Your affectionate brother and obliged humble servant,</div>
<div class="signature2"><span class="smcap">P. Doddridge</span>.</div></blockquote>

<p>One more entry we have in the Church-book, relating
to his success as a pastor:&mdash;</p>

<div class="hanging"><i>Some Remarks which have occurred to me on the State of the
Church since January 1st, 1747, which I note for the
Instruction of any future Pastor.</i></div>

<blockquote><p>At the time above mentioned, I took a review of the number
of Church members, which I found more decreased since
Michaelmas, 1745, than I ever knew it to be in double that
time; for I found that since that time we have received only
15 members, and have lost 17; 12 have died or removed the
last year, and only 8 of the 15 have been admitted this year;
so that our decrease since Michaelmas, 1745, is 2, and since
this time twelve-months, on the whole, 4&mdash;a very discouraging
circumstance, especially considering how much I have
abounded in exhortations to the Lord's table during the last
year.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;The <i>omission</i> of the names of three, since recollected,
who were admitted in 1745, made the state of affairs appear
more melancholy than I afterwards found it to be.</p></blockquote>

<p>His last statement is&mdash;"In looking over the account
for the year 1749, I find that 22 had been admitted,
and 22 removed by death or otherwise; so that we
were just as at the beginning of the year&mdash;in all, 239."</p>

<p>These statements rather surprise us; considering
what the writer of them had devolving upon him in
the care of his academy, in his extensive correspondence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
in his numerous and valuable publications, that
he should, amidst all this, pay so particular and minute
attention to the state of the Church of which he was
pastor. It shows strikingly the activity, ardour, and
entire devotedness of his spirit. But, alas! it was too
active and ardent for the material framework long to
sustain the efforts to which it was impelled. Hence
the very next entry we meet with is, "That the
Rev. Philip Doddridge, Doctor of Divinity, after being
twenty-one years pastor of this Church, died at Lisbon,
to which place he had resorted for the recovery of
his health, on the 26th of October, 1751, we may truly
say, to the unspeakable loss of this Church."</p>

<p>How he lived and how he died is very extensively
known, by the Memoir published by Orton&mdash;the "Centenary
Memorial" of him recently sent forth by Stoughton;
so that, though we would fain linger over his
memory, yet anything further respecting him would
seem to be out of place here.</p>

<p>We happen to have in our possession a copy of the
poem sacred to the memory of Doddridge, as it was
first published by its author, Mr. Henry Moore, who
had been one of the Doctor's students, and was afterwards
settled as a minister in Devonshire. It is the
same poem in substance as is given by Orton at the
close of his 'Memoirs of Doddridge'; but it is there
considerably altered from this first copy. It is thus
inscribed to Mrs. Doddridge:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Permit me, Madam, to present to you the following poem,
as a testimony of my high veneration for the memory of my
deceased tutor, and my tender sympathy with his afflicted
family.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am, Madam, your most obliged humble servant,</p>
<div class="signature">H&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash;.</div>
<p><i>Northampton, February, 1st, 1752.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>We extract the following lines from pages 7-9:&mdash;</p>

<p>
O, snatch'd for ever, ever from our view,<br />
Thou best, thou greatest of thy kind, adieu!<br />
Thou, in whose ample, comprehensive mind,<br />
All the ten thousand streams of science join'd;&mdash;<br />
All the fair train of social virtues smil'd,<br />
And bright religion beam'd divinely mild.<br />
Ah, love shall listen with delight no more,<br />
While from thy lips Truth pours her sacred store;&mdash;<br />
No more, while studious to instruct and please,<br />
You temper serious sense with graceful ease;&mdash;<br />
No more, with zeal for God and virtue fired,<br />
By reason govern'd, and by heaven inspired,<br />
Thy various eloquence our ears shall charm,<br />
Command our passions, and our bosoms warm;<br />
Bid in our breast seraphic raptures roll,<br />
And spread the generous flame from soul to soul;<br />
While sinners start, by conscious terror stung,<br />
And tremble at the thunder of thy tongue.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Once more, adieu! O friend, instructor, guide,</span><br />
With whom our hopes, our fairest prospects died.<br />
With what fond zeal we press'd the throne divine,<br />
To rescue from the grave a life like thine!<br />
If ardent prayers&mdash;if streaming sorrows, shed<br />
In all the bitterness of soul&mdash;could plead,<br />
Our prayers, O Doddridge! had revers'd thy doom,<br />
And tens of thousands wept thee from the tomb.<br />
But cease, rash Muse&mdash;oh, tremble to repine!<br />
'Tis heaven demands him, and we must resign.<br />
All-perfect Goodness ever wills the best:<br />
Then bow submissive to the high behest,<br />
And silent drop the tributary tear<br />
That nature's forced to pay to friendship dear.<br />
Though heaven forbids us to indulge our grief,<br />
A tear it will allow&mdash;the soul's relief.<br />
Yet who would wish him still confin'd below,<br />
Struggling with dire disease, or loads of woe?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then dry the tear, suppress the rising sigh,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>Weep not for him who could rejoice to die.<br />
E'en when the quiv'ring pulse, the panting breath,<br />
And clay-cold sweat, presag'd th' approach of death,<br />
His steady soul, by conscious virtue arm'd,<br />
No inward stings or gathering clouds alarm'd.<br />
Calm as the silent surface of the sea,<br />
When ev'n the gentle breeze has ceased to play,<br />
Fair hope, strong faith, his sinking soul sustain'd,<br />
In smiling peace each rising care seren'd;<br />
Heav'n on the saint shed down her cheering ray,<br />
And open'd on his mind her dawning day.<br />
Then his warm breast with bliss ecstatic glow'd,<br />
Fir'd with th' approaching vision of his God.<br />
Impatient of his soul-confining chains,<br />
Eager he welcom'd the dissolving pains;<br />
Already seem'd on seraphs' wings to rise,<br />
Already spurn'd his dust, and tower'd into the skies.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Methought I saw him mount the starry way,</span><br />
His temples beaming with celestial day.<br />
Rapt in a flamy car, sublime he flew&mdash;<br />
The flamy car fire-breathing coursers drew;<br />
Swift as the lightning glimpse he flash'd along;<br />
While, waiting for his flight, a white-rob'd throng<br />
(Once wretched souls, enslaved by Satan's yoke,<br />
Whose painful bonds his arduous labours broke),<br />
Grateful and happy, smile to see him rise,<br />
And hail him welcome to th' applauding skies;<br />
Ten thousand harps, harmonious as the spheres,<br />
Proclaim their joy, and charm his ravish'd ears.<br />
</p>

<p>In proceeding with the Memorials of this Church,
now bereft of its beloved and honoured Doddridge, we
find that the Rev. Robert Gilbert was called to be the
pastor, and entered upon the pastoral charge at Lady-day,
1753. This worthy man died December 28th,
1760. We are unable to ascertain what was the condition
of the Church during the ministry of Mr. Gilbert;
but have some reason to conclude that it was
not in a united or prosperous state. Considerable
difficulty might be expected to attend the choice of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
successor to such a pastor as the one that had immediately
preceded; and this more fully appeared after
Mr. Gilbert's short course of labour had closed.</p>

<p>Mr. Hextal was the next pastor of the Church. He
was a native of Broughton, near Kettering; became a
member of the Church at Kettering under Mr. Saunders;
for which, see the Memorials of the Church at
Kettering. He was a student at Northampton under
Dr. Doddridge; first settled at Creaton, then at Sudbury,
from which place he came to Northampton. We
have no record of the time when he entered on his
ministry at Castle Hill, and no account of anything
that transpired during his ministry; but under the
date of April 16, 1775, we have this record: "It was
this day agreed, by a majority of eighteen brethren of
this Church, to dismiss the Rev. Mr. Hextal from his
office as pastor, minister, and teacher." This appears
to have led to very painful altercations between the
friends of Mr. Hextal and those that were opposed to
him, which ultimately led to a separation from the
Church and congregation. Those who were attached
to Mr. Hextal endeavoured to regain the pulpit for
him by a process of law, pleading the right of the subscribers
to a vote for the pastor; but this was overruled,
as contrary to the deed which gives "the power
to the Church (upon giving six days' notice by the
deacons) to elect, place, and displace a minister as they
think proper." The result was, that Mr. Hextal's
friends withdrew, and built the Chapel in King Street,
where Mr. Hextal ministered till the close of his life.
The names of thirty members are given, as having
been first admonished for withdrawing themselves
from the Church, and, refusing to return, were declared
as no longer standing in this relation to them. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
name of Mary Doddridge occurs amongst those who
had withdrawn. In 'Orton's Letters to Dissenting
Ministers,' we have the following passage, in a letter
dated December 26, 1762: "My last letters from
Northampton encourage me to hope that Mr. Hextal
will be comfortable and useful there." To this, Mr.
Palmer, the editor, appends the following note:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>An amiable and respectable minister, who removed from
Sudbury on account of dissensions occasioned by a party
spirit in electing members of Parliament, and succeeded Mr.
Gilbert in the congregation of which Dr. Doddridge had been
pastor, where he soon met with equally cruel usage, and was
obliged to withdraw to a new Chapel which his friends erected
for him, where he ended his days in peace. His great candour
and benevolence gave occasion to morose-minded people, who
disliked some that espoused his cause, to charge him with a
want of orthodoxy; whereas, in point of sentiment, he was in
fact higher than the generality of acknowledged Calvinists.
Such is the blindness of bigotry.</p></blockquote>

<p>These unhappy circumstances greatly diminished
the numbers in the Church. Under date of April
24th, 1777, we find the names of only 64 members,
showing a great decrease since the death of Doddridge.</p>

<p>Rev. John Horsey was unanimously invited to the
pastoral office February 2nd, 1777, and testified his
acceptance of it on the 2nd of March. He was dismissed
from the Church at Ringwood, to be received
as a member of the Church at Northampton, and then
ordained as the minister. The following is the account
Mr. Horsey gives of the ordination service:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Having accepted the pressing solicitations of my friends, I
was solemnly separated to the pastoral office over the Church
of Christ assembling on Castle Hill, Northampton, on May
14th, 1777. Mr. Scott, of Hinkley, began with prayer, and
reading the 100th Psalm and 3rd Chapter 1st Epistle to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Timothy. Mr. Towle, of London, delivered an introductory
discourse, received the Church's account of the steps they
had previously taken, read by Mr. John Wood, together with
a renewal of their call; I testified likewise my acceptance of
it, and delivered my confession of faith. Mr. Saunders, of
Bedworth, set me apart by prayer and imposition of hands;
Mr. King, of Welford, gave the charge, founded on 1st Cor.
iv. 2; Mr. Rowley, of Warwick, prayed; Dr. Mayo, of London,
preached on 2nd Cor. iv. 5; and Mr. Bull, of Newport,
concluded in prayer. Our assisting friends officiated respectively
with an amiable order and propriety, the Divine Spirit
was eminently with us, and his blessing, we hope, will attend
the important transactions of the day.</p>

<p><i>June 1st.</i>&mdash;I administered the Lord's Supper for the first
time; it was a very comfortable season. May God grant us
his presence in our future engagements of a similar nature!</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Horsey's ministry over this people extended
to the lengthened period of fifty years, during which
time 170 members were added to the Church. He died
on May 12th, 1827. Mr. Horsey was a man of very
gentlemanly appearance and manners, great ease, affability,
and much kindness; his style as a preacher
pleasing, and rather attractive, not distinguished by
much energy; but we have heard that in the first
years of his ministry at Northampton it was popular,
and drew together a rather crowded congregation.</p>

<p>Much has been said and written respecting Mr.
Horsey's deficiency in orthodox views, or in distinct
statements on some of the great points of evangelical
truth. He had the charge of the academy for a time
after its removal from Daventry, at the resignation of
Mr. Belsham. Suspicions arising as to his sentiments
on the person and work of Christ, he resigned his
office as tutor, and the academy was for a time broken
up; nor was the Church or congregation after this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
in a flourishing state under the ministry of Mr. Horsey.
The attendance declined; the number of members diminished.
This may be the case under certain circumstances
where there is no deficiency in truth, or piety,
or ability, on the part of the ministry, and hence may
present no certain criterion of the one or the other;
and there were a number, we believe, of truly pious
devout persons of evangelical sentiments, who continued
under the ministry of Mr. Horsey, esteemed his
character, and prized his preaching. Yet it must be
allowed, we apprehend, that there was a certain vagueness
in his statements respecting the person and work
of the Redeemer, which showed either that the mind
of the preacher was not earnestly intent on discovering
and grasping the truth, under a powerful impression
of the value of the truth, or that it had formed opinions
to which it was unwilling to give a clear and
distinct utterance; but Mr. Horsey manifested the
spirit of devotion, and a humble reliance on Christ as
the Saviour of sinners, and would be found "looking
for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal
life."</p>

<p>When Mr. Horsey's infirmities increased so as to
render him incapable of fulfilling all the duties of his
office, Mr. Charles Hyatt was invited to become co-pastor;
but Mr. Horsey being removed by death before
this connexion had been completed, Mr. Hyatt was
then invited to take the pastoral charge, which he
accepted, and was ordained September 25th, 1827.
We present Mr. Hyatt's account of the engagements
of the day:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>After solemn deliberation and prayer to God for direction,
I accepted the invitation of my kind friends at Castle Hill to
become their pastor, and conveyed that resolution in a letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
to the Church, 1827. On Wednesday, September 26th, I was
solemnly recognized as the pastor of the Church. Mr. Edwards,
of King's Head Lane (now King Street) Meeting, commenced
the services of the day by reading and prayer; Mr. Robertson,
of Wellingborough, delivered the introductory discourse; Mr.
Toller, of Kettering, asked the usual questions; Mr. Hyatt,
senior, offered up the ordination prayer; Mr. Morrell, of Wymondley,
delivered the charge, founded on Rev. ii. 10; Mr.
Fletcher, of Stepney, preached to the people, from 1st Cor.
xvi. 14; Mr. Gray, of College Lane, concluded with prayer.
It was a most delightful and interesting service. Nearly 50
ministers were present, and the impressions then made will,
it is hoped, never wear away.</p></blockquote>

<p>After this settlement, some of the friends of the late
Mr. Horsey separated from the Church and congregation,
and commenced the Unitarian interest in the
town. On this subject we present the following statement&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Friday, November 22nd, 1827, we held our first Church-meeting,
when the following letter was read to the Church:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">"<i>To the Church of Christ assembling under the pastoral care
of the Rev. Charles Hyatt.</i></div>

<p>"We, the undersigned members of the Church of Christ
assembling in Castle Hill Meeting, having, in obedience to
the dictates of our consciences, united in the formation of a
society of Christians, whose worship is directed solely to the
one God the Father, agreeably to the express injunctions of
our Saviour, deem it proper to withdraw, and hereby beg
leave to announce our withdrawment, from the worship and
communion of the Church to which we have hitherto belonged,
on account of the discordance existing between the mode of
worship as there practised and that which we believe to have
been enjoined and observed by Christ and his apostles."&mdash;(Signed
by nine members.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The individuals who signed this letter, in connexion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
with some of the subscribers, formed themselves into
a society professing Unitarian sentiments.</p>

<p>The list of the members at Castle Hill after this
contains but fifty names.</p>

<p>Mr. Hyatt's ministry in Northampton continued
six years and three months, when he removed to be
co-pastor with his father in London. He preached
his farewell sermon March 21st, 1833. Something
more than eighty members appear to have been admitted
during this period.</p>

<p>Mr. Hyatt was the son of the Rev. Charles Hyatt,
of Shadwell, London. He was born in the year 1805.
Trained in the fear of God, he resolved, on leaving
school, to devote himself to studies preparatory to the
Christian ministry. Although but fifteen years of
age when he formed this resolution, yet he was eligible
for admission into Wymondley College, under the auspices
of the trustees of Mr. Coward, and accordingly
he entered there in 1820, under the patronage of Dr.
Collyer. He honourably occupied six years in his
studies, and then became the pastor of the Church at
Northampton.</p>

<p>He was strongly urged by his father to resign his
charge at Northampton, to undertake the co-pastorate
with him in the Church at Ebenezer Chapel, Shadwell&mdash;the
people having invited him to this office.
His acquiescence in this request proved a great source
of comfort to his venerable father, with whom he
indeed laboured "as a son with the father" in the
Gospel. He took an active part in the labours of the
British and Foreign Sailors' Society, and, in 1844,
was chosen to be its secretary. The growing infirmities
of his honoured father threw the whole
weight of pastoral duties upon him; and his frame,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
always delicate and prone to disease, began to yield
to the pressure of labour, which was too much for his
strength. On the 16th of June, 1846, his venerated
father died; and in nine short months after this, the
happy spirit of the son was gathered to his fathers.
This change came upon him somewhat by surprise.
It is a well known symptom in pulmonary disorders,
to look for restoration to health and activity even to
the last; and when, therefore, he learned from his
physician that there was no hope of his ultimate
recovery, it was to him an unexpected announcement.
But it caused him neither depression nor alarm. He
was prepared for the event; and in the last days of
his sickness he was favoured with a continued rapture
of love, hope, and joy, which was never interrupted
but by the paroxysms of pain which terminated
his amiable and holy life. He died in the 42nd
year of his age.</p>

<p>Rev. John Bennett succeeded Mr. Hyatt in the
pastoral charge at Castle Hill in June, 1833, and is
the present minister of this Church. The number of
communicants at the present time is 160. There are
300 children in the Sabbath-schools.</p>

<p>Since the commencement of Mr. Bennett's pastorate,
four young men have gone out from this Church
into the regular ministry. Three members of the
Church are almost constantly engaged in village-preaching;
but there are no stations connected with
the Chapel.</p>

<p>The present Meeting House was built in the year
1695. It is just according to the general fashion of
Dissenting places of worship of that era, in respectable
towns&mdash;a plain building, entirely destitute of architectural
ornaments, three galleries, and large pillars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to support the roof. Commodious school-rooms were
built for the Sabbath-school in the year 1825, at a cost
probably of 500. About fourteen years ago the lower
part of the Chapel was entirely repaired; lobbies made
for the gallery stairs, stone steps to the galleries, new
aisles, and cost about 400. It has just undergone
considerable alterations&mdash;pillars removed, new roof,
and new galleries, at a cost of 500. It was re-opened
for worship on Wednesday, the 6th of October.
We have been favoured with the following account of
the services by the pastor:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>On the Wednesday morning the Rev. J. Sherman, of Surrey
Chapel, preached an admirable sermon, to a very large and
deeply interested audience, the Rev. T. Thomas, of Wellingborough,
having commenced the service with reading and prayer.
In the evening the service was opened by the Rev. W. Todman, of
Yardley, Hastings, who read the Scriptures and prayed. The
Rev. Dr. Archer, of London, then delivered a most eloquent discourse,
which was listened to with the deepest interest by an
audience which filled the Chapel to overflowing. The friends
dined together, and took tea at the Milton Hall. On the
following Sabbath the Rev. H. Toller, of Market Harborough,
preached morning and evening, with his customary power
and acceptance, to overflowing congregations. The various
collections amounted to more than 85. The cordial and
fraternal spirit manifested by the other Dissenting Churches
in the town was such as to afford the deepest gratification to
the friends of the Redeemer at Castle Hill. Altogether, the
occasion will long be remembered with pleasure and thankfulness
by this ancient Christian society.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the vestry are Doddridge's table, chair, and
looking-glass.</p>

<p>The present state of the Church at Castle Hill is
such as, we have no doubt, excites grateful emotions to
the God of all grace from the pastor and his flock;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and in the words of their beloved Doddridge they
would say,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Th' eternal Shepherd still survives,</span><br />
<span class="i1">New comfort to impart;</span><br />
<span class="i0">His eye still guides us, and his voice</span><br />
<span class="i1">Still animates our heart."</span>
</div>


<h4>SECTION 3.&mdash;THE CHURCH AT KING'S-STREET.</h4>

<p>When discord and contentions arise in a Christian
society they are productive of great evils&mdash;opposed
to the spirit of the Gospel, they prove a hindrance to
the advancement of individual piety, and to the extension
of the kingdom of Christ among men. Yet
the God who "makes the wrath of man to praise
him," often overrules the disagreements that arise in
his Churches for "the furtherance of the Gospel."
In the preceding account of the Church at Castle
Hill it will have been seen that during the ministry
of Mr. Hextal dissensions arose, which led to his dismissal
from his office as pastor by a majority of the
Church.</p>

<p>In the month of August, 1774, Mr. Hextal was
afflicted with a disease which rendered him incapable
of fulfilling all his duties as pastor of the Church at
Castle Hill. It was therefore determined to invite
an assistant; and it appears that the greater part of
the Church wished to have a minister who was not
quite agreeable to Mr. Hextal and the major part of
the subscribers. This was the occasion of much dissension.
A great deal of acrimonious feeling was
manifested; pamphlets were written on both sides;
and at length a separation ensued; the Chapel in King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Street was built, and Mr. Hextal carried on his ministry
there. It was erected in the year 1776.</p>

<p>In a preface written by Mr. Hextal to one of the
pamphlets that was published, we find the following
paragraph, which we extract as expressive of the
principles he maintained, and the spirit he wished to
exemplify and promote. After censuring the injudicious
zeal of some, he observes,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>I mention these things, not to encourage a disregard or
indifference about the peculiar doctrines of the Gospel&mdash;far
be such a thought from me. I believe them, and will earnestly
contend for them in the spirit of meekness. The doctrine of
the divinity of Christ, on which I humbly apprehend the
efficacy of his atonement depends; the fall of man, or his
lost estate by the great apostacy; the deity of the Spirit,
and the necessity of his influences to renew fallen man to the
divine life, are doctrines I believe evidently discovered in
Scripture. These I have constantly insisted upon in the
course of my ministry, for the truth of which I can appeal to
those who have heard me ever since I came to this place.
But it has ever been my opinion, that these doctrines, which I
look upon as the distinguishing glory of the Gospel, should be
maintained in the spirit of love and candour, with soft words
and the strongest arguments we can use; and sorry I am that
the word 'candour' should sound harsh, and give offence to
any Christians, especially to any that belong to the Church
and congregation that enjoyed so long such a burning and
shining light as Dr. Doddridge, in whose example and ministry
the zeal for Gospel truth adorned with moderation, benevolence,
and charity, appeared with such an amiable lustre;
and who, "though dead, yet speaketh" in his learned, valuable,
and useful writings. * * * May we all
be thoroughly convinced, and helped to act agreeable to the
conviction, that he is the brightest ornament of his Christian
profession, the best friend to the Church of Christ, and partakes
most of the temper of heaven, who best loves all of every
denomination that he thinks bear the name of Jesus, and most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
readily exercises candour and forbearance to those who differ
from him in non-essentials. Should the separation here be
permitted to continue, may we live in peace, and sincerely
pray for each other.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here Mr. Hextal laboured until the close of his
ministry, and ended his days amongst this people,
dying at the age of 66 years.</p>

<p>The following inscription is on a tablet in the
Chapel:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">LOVE ONE ANOTHER.</div>

<blockquote><p>Sacred to the memory of the Rev. <span class="smcap">William Hextal</span>,
a faithful minister of the Gospel, and sometime pastor of
this Christian society; who remarkably exhibited in his
life what he warmly recommended from the pulpit,&mdash;unfeigned
piety to God, and universal benevolence to
men.</p>

<p>Having endured many and great afflictions, both in
body and mind, he entered into the rest which remains
for the people of God, November 4th, 1777, aged 66.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Porter was the next pastor of the Church,
entering on his office a short time after the death of
Mr. Hextal. The register of baptisms, it is stated,
was begun <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1778, by Thomas Porter, pastor of
the congregation that assembles in Kingshead Lane,
Northampton. The last entry made by Mr. Porter
is of a baptism that took place August 8th, 1784;
the next being by Mr. Edwards, August 13th, 1786;
so that Mr. Porter's ministry was not continued for
much more than six years.</p>

<p>About the year 1786, Mr. B. L. Edwards became
the pastor of this Church, and filled this office for
45 years, as he died January 2nd, 1831, aged 66
years. The following account of Mr. Edwards appeared
in the <i>Congregational Magazine</i>, shortly after his
death:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Mr. Edwards pursued his preparatory studies for the
ministry at the Theological Institution then conducted at
Hoxton, we believe under the tuition of Drs. Savage, Kippis,
and Rees; and from thence he proceeded to the station which
for so many years he has occupied with an unblemished
character. As a minister of Christ, he united orthodoxy of
sentiment with liberality of spirit; as a man, he was admired
most by those who were best acquainted with him&mdash;warm
and faithful in his friendships, of a most enlarged benevolence,
and universally regarded as the ardent and consistent
advocate of civil and religious liberty throughout the world.
The later years of life were distinguished by a growing
spirituality of mind; and as he drew near to the close of his
labours upon earth, he seemed to increase in the fervour
of his public ministrations. The illness which terminated
in his death was of short duration. On the second Sabbath
in December he preached three times: on the afternoon of
the day he delivered a funeral discourse, founded on the
exhortation of Christ to his disciples, "Be ye also ready," and
distinguished by unusual earnestness and deep solemnity;
and in the evening he closed his public labours by a sermon
from Psalm xxxi. 19. Though from that time till within
three or four days of his departure he was too unwell to leave
the house, yet no painful apprehensions of immediate danger
were excited in the minds of his friends. On the Thursday
night preceding his dissolution he became, however, materially
worse, from which time he rapidly declined, until,
on the morning of the Sabbath, he received the summons,
and entered into rest. An individual who on two occasions
saw him during his illness, was gratified with the delightful
frame of spirit he discovered when speaking of the heavenly
world, and the blessedness of those who had reached that
place. He is understood to have declared, a short time before
his departure, his simple reliance upon the atonement of
Christ; and in the anticipation of the great change, to have
adopted the words of the Apostle, "I know whom I have
believed." The nature of his afflictions, however, prevented
him from conversing much; and though he expressed sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to satisfy his friends as to the calm and happy state of
his mind, their hope of his meetness for the kingdom of
heaven rests upon the evidence which a long life furnishes
to them spent in the cause of Christ, and for the good of
men.</p>

<p>His mortal remains were committed to the earth on the
11th of January, in the presence of a large assembly, within
the walls of the place in which, for so long a period, he had
preached the Gospel of the grace of God. Mr. Griffiths, of
Buckby, delivered the funeral oration; Mr. B. Hobson, of
Welford, and Mr. T. Toller, of Kettering, conducted the
devotional parts of the service. On the Sabbath following,
the funeral sermon was preached to a crowded auditory, from
a part of the 7th and 8th verses of the 4th chapter of the 2nd
Epistle to Timothy, by Mr. James Robertson, of Wellingborough.
Mr. Edwards for many years filled the office of
Secretary to the Association of Independent Ministers of the
County of Northampton, and was a liberal and disinterested
supporter of the Provident Society connected with it.</p></blockquote>

<p>The following inscription is in the Chapel for Mr.
Edwards:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
To the memory of <span class="smcap">Benj. Loyd Edwards</span>,<br />
upwards of 45 years the able, conscientious,<br />
and affectionate pastor of the congregation<br />
assembling within these walls,<br />
this tablet is placed by his bereaved flock,<br />
as a testimonial of his faithfulness in,<br />
and their gratitude for, a connexion<br />
which terminated only with<br />
his lamented death, on the 11th of January, 1831,<br />
in the 67th year of his age.
</div>

<p>Mr. John Woodward became the pastor of the
Church July 1st, 1832. It appears that though this
congregation has been highly respectable, yet the
number of Church members has been comparatively
few; for when Mr. Woodward became pastor, a list of
members is given, numbering 33. From this time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
to April 5th, 1835, when Mr. Woodward resigned,
15 persons had been admitted to the fellowship of the
Church.</p>

<p>The next pastor was Mr. Thomas Milner, M.A.,
known as the author of 'The Seven Churches of
Asia;' 'The Life and Times of Dr. Watts;' 'Scripture
and Astronomy;' 'Gallery of Nature;' 'Descriptive
Atlas of Astronomy,' &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>November 28th, 1847, Mr. G. Nicholson, B.A., the
present pastor, entered on his labours here. Since
that time 25 persons have been admitted to the Church,
so that the present number of communicants is 72.</p>

<p>During the ministry of Mr. Milner new school-rooms
were erected, at a cost of 336. 6<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> There
are 95 children in the Sabbath-schools.</p>

<p>The accommodation in the Chapel, we are informed,
is not so great as it ought to be; nearly every seat
being taken, so that there is no surplus room to which
to invite the poor. Architectural difficulties have
hitherto stood in the way of enlargement, but it is
hoped that some way of surmounting them will, in no
very distant period, be found.</p>


<h4>SECTION 4.&mdash;COMMERCIAL STREET CHAPEL.</h4>

<p>The Independent Chapel in Commercial Street,
Northampton, presents a pleasing memorial of the
Christian zeal and liberality of the late Thomas Wilson,
Esq., of Highbury Place, London&mdash;a gentleman
who devoted his time, his energies, and his property
to the promotion of the cause of Christ, more immediately
among Protestant Dissenters of the Independent
denomination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Wilson's attention was directed to the town of
Northampton as a place which, on account of its increasing
population, required some additional efforts
for promoting the kingdom of the Redeemer. After
many inquiries had been made for ground that would
present an eligible site on which to erect a Chapel,
a purchase was made in Commercial Street for 600;
and a neat and respectable Chapel, sixty-two feet by
forty-two, was there erected, at a cost of 2,000, besides
100 for alterations. This was at a considerable
distance from other places of worship.</p>

<p>The Chapel was opened for public service on the
9th of April, 1829. The Rev. J. A. James, of Birmingham,
preached a very excellent sermon in the
morning, on sanctification, from John xvii. 17&mdash;"Sanctify
them through thy truth; thy word is
truth."</p>

<p>Rev. J. Stratten, of Paddington, preached with much
energy in the evening, from 2 Thess. iii. 1&mdash;"Finally,
brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may
have free course, and be glorified."</p>

<p>The Chapel was for some time supplied by the Rev.
Messrs. Blackburn and J. Clayton, of London; Adkins,
of Southampton; Gear, of Harborough; Johnson, of
Farnham; and Prust, of Highbury College.</p>

<p>After the Rev. Edmund Thornton Prust had finished
his studies at Highbury, he was invited by the
congregation, no Church having then been formed, to
supply for six months.</p>

<p>On the 1st of December, 1829, a Christian Church
was formed in the presence of Mr. Walter Scott, late
of Rowell, now of Airdale, and the late J. Pinkerton,
of Weedon.</p>

<p>Mr. Prust was afterwards chosen to the pastoral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
office by the Church and congregation unitedly, and
was ordained on the 21st of April, 1830, when the
following ministers were engaged:&mdash;Mr. B. L. Edwards,
of Northampton, read the Scriptures and
prayed&mdash;Thomas Toller, of Kettering, delivered the
introductory discourse&mdash;John Sibree, of Coventry,
asked the questions, and received the confession of
faith&mdash;Walter Scott, of Rowell, offered the ordination
prayer&mdash;John Leifchild, of Bristol (now Dr. Leifchild,
of London), gave the charge, from 1 Tim. iv. 6, "A
good minister of Jesus Christ," which was published
by request&mdash;Charles Hyatt, sen., of London, concluded
with prayer.</p>

<p>In the evening the Rev. C. J. Hyatt, of Northampton,
read and prayed&mdash;J. W. Percy, of Warwick,
preached to the people, from 1 Thess. v. 13, 14&mdash;W.
Gray, of Northampton, concluded with prayer.</p>

<p>The following reference is made to the services of
the day, in an advertisement prefixed to the printed
charge:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>The ordination was attended by a number of his brethren
of the town and neighbourhood, of several denominations,
who gave on that occasion an instance of brotherly love and
concord that will not soon be forgotten. The young minister,
with his only remaining parent, and the patron of the Institution
from whence he had emanated, seated on either side,
received the following address from a minister of his native
city, who was well authorized to bear on that occasion a
public testimony to his respectable attainments, his unblemished
reputation, and his amiable manners, which from
a child had procured him the esteem of a large circle of
friends and acquaintance. A spirit of fervent love, of
ardent prayer, and of devout seriousness, characterized the
services of the day, and inspired the hearts of all who witnessed
them with hopes of the most pleasing results.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Twenty-two years have passed since then, and
those pleasing results have, through the blessing of the
great Head of the Church, to a great extent been
realized. The Church, which was originally formed
of eight members who had received dismissions from
Churches to which they had previously belonged, has
received from the commencement to the present time
315 members. The present number of communicants
is about 150. The number of scholars in the Sabbath-schools
is about 400.</p>

<p>Since the decease of Mr. Wilson, a marble tablet
has been erected in the porch of the Chapel, with the
following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>This Chapel was built <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1829, at the sole expense of
the late Thomas Wilson, Esq., of Highbury Place, London.</p>

<p>This tablet is erected in grateful commemoration of his
liberality.</p></blockquote>

<p>The congregation have erected galleries in the
Chapel, with organ, and an additional school-room, at a
cost of nearly 1000. A commodious school-room has
also been lately built, on a site adjoining the Chapel-yard,
for Sunday and Day Infant-schools, with class-rooms
for senior scholars. The daily Infant-school
numbers more than 120 children, and the Sunday
Infant Class about 170. A tablet in the school-room
has the following inscription:&mdash;"This School-room was
built <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1851, for the use of Sunday and Day Infant
Schools in connexion with Commercial Street Chapel,
and in memory of Stephen Prust, Esq., of Bristol, who
was only prevented by death from erecting it himself."</p>

<p>In looking at the whole, encouraging indications, we
consider, may be very clearly discerned of the Divine
blessing attending the word of heavenly truth, and giving
sanction and success to the efforts of his servants.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>MEMORIALS OF THE INDEPENDENT CHURCH AT
ROWELL.</h3>


<p>In the days of the Commonwealth, when Cromwell
was Lord Protector of England, a greater degree of
liberty for the worship of God and the preaching of
the Gospel was enjoyed, than had been known for many
centuries before, or was again known till the revolution
by William. During this period there came to Rowell,
a populous village in the county of Northampton, Mr.
John Beverley, a devoted Puritan, to preach the Gospel
of Christ. This was in the year 1654. His labours
were rendered successful in bringing a number of persons
to an acquaintance with the Saviour he preached;
and they were willing to make a profession of their
faith in Christ Jesus. He directed those who had
received the Redeemer to form themselves into a Congregational
Church, for the enjoyment of divine ordinances
in their purity.</p>

<p>Mr. Beverley appears to have been a man of eminent
devotedness to God, partaking largely of the spirit of
evangelical, practical, and experimental piety. His attainments
in learning were considerable: he had been
a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge; but he dedicated
all that he had attained to the service of God in
the ministry of the Gospel. He had a living offered to
him worth 200 per annum, but he preferred labouring
at Rowell, where he was not sure of 50; and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
greatly rejoiced in the success that attended his labours.
In the year 1655, those who had been converted under
his ministry became united together in the fellowship
of the Gospel as a Christian society. A Church covenant
was drawn up, and signed by every member. This
being the earliest of the kind that we have discovered
among the Northamptonshire Churches, it may not be
unsuitable to give it a place in these Memorials.</p>

<div class="center">
<i>The memor. of a Covenant renewed and subscribed by the<br />
reformed Church at Rowell.</i>
</div>

<blockquote><p>Whereas, being by nature enemies to God and aliens from his
covenant of mercy, hateful and hating one another, it pleased
God of his free grace to admit us into covenant privileges by
baptism, wherein we engaged, and whereby we were bound, to
walk as new creatures adopted and redeemed, wholly attending
to his blessed will revealed in the Gospel, we do now, with
shame and loathing of ourselves, most solemnly acknowledge
to his glory that we have most abominably corrupted ourselves,
his worship, and the holy covenant of our peace, to the blemish
of our holy profession, the scandalizing of many, the grief of
God's Holy Spirit and people, and now, through mercy, to the
grief of our own spirits; so that we abhor ourselves for all our
former ignorant and disorderly walking. And seeing how
God hath called upon us by his word and Spirit to lay hold
yet again of his covenant, as in a proper season of reformation&mdash;seeing
he is pleased to continue the proposal of such an unworthy
people to himself, lo! how can we be ashamed of his
truth and Gospel? We do, therefore, humbly tender ourselves
to Jesus Christ and his ministry, in this renewed profession
and covenant subscribed&mdash;viz., that, through the grace of
God, we will constantly maintain and walk according to the
whole will of God revealed in the Scriptures, and comprised in
the articles above mentioned;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> professing them against all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
error, heresy, and profaneness, in due order, as members of
this one particular Church, for enjoyment of all Christ's ordinances,
performance of all members' duties, in subjection to
our pastors, ruling officers, and to each other in the Lord;
holding due communion with all other reformed Churches of
Christ in the world, that so we may be built up in knowledge
and holiness, better to maintain our obedience to Christ, the
common interest of the saints, and so more please and glorify
God. Accordingly attest to remember his covenant and us, in
the approaching day of our blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ, to whom be all glory for ever. Amen.</p>

<p>Anno Domini 1655.</p>

<p>(Signed, John Beverley, Pastor; John Ponder, John Cooper,
Elders; John Fox, Ralph Mun, Deacons. Then follow the
names of thirty members.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Beverley's was a short but a useful course at
Rowell. After about four years' labour amongst them,
he was removed by death, June 2nd, 1658. Some
extracts we have seen from his diary strikingly indicate
the possession of deep and experimental piety, and
show that he often had great enjoyment in intercourse
with God. It was seen in his spirit and conduct that he
was a "man of God." His labours at Rowell, though
short, were attended with the most important and permanent
result, the benefits of which were experienced
by the descendants of his flock.</p>

<p>He was a zealous advocate for the Congregational
principles of Church government, writing several tracts
in their support, addressing a letter to Dr. Owen, entreating
him to employ his powers in their defence, in
which he says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>To whom should such a truth, in such an extremity, betake
herself for relief among all her children rather than to yourself,
or such as you can prevail with? and judge, if you can
justly, any more fit than yourself, even yourself, who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
such a name in the learned and Christian world already, as
that your very appearing might be sufficient vindication.
May I not charge you in Christ's name to rise up once more
for Christ, and for this part of his truth, also as in a former
Church case, Esther iv. 14? What account can be given, but
that God, foreseeing how useful you might be in such a juncture
for relief of his truth now abused, did choose to set yourself
in that signal place at Oxford, even for so signal a service,
for such a signal portion of truth? And can you forbear to
extend your hand in such a cause, who can dispatch so noble
a work with such ease and facility?</p></blockquote>

<p>It is justly observed by Mr. Maurice, that Mr.
Beverley was a man of great zeal for the cause of God,
guided by that wisdom which is from above. This
zeal was expressed in his own personal labours for
Christ, in the place and among the people where
Providence had fixed him; in his great concern for
those places within his knowledge where the Gospel
was not preached; and then in his earnest endeavours
to stir up his fellow-labourers to be found forward in
all their duty to Christ and his house.</p>

<p>When Mr. Beverley was removed by death, the
Church at Rowell was "young and tender"; yet its
members had been so well instructed in the things of
the Gospel, and in their connexion with each other as
a Christian society, that they exhorted each other and
prayed together, and went constantly to Desborough
for a time, two miles distant, to attend on the ministry
of Mr. Browning, who, being afterwards ejected from
his living, became pastor of the Church at Rowell.</p>

<p>Of Mr. Browning's early life, conversion to God,
and entrance on the ministry, some account has been
preserved, from which we obtain the following information:&mdash;That
he descended from pious parents&mdash;was a
child of many prayers&mdash;that his parents early dedicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
him to God with a view to the ministry of the
Gospel, and sent him to Oxford with this design; but
his conduct was such as to cause great grief to them,
and to involve himself in distress. After some years
he was brought, by the divine blessing on the faithful
preaching of the Gospel, to deep conviction of sin, and
a real return unto God. He became united to a Church
at Coggeshall, in Essex; his pastor and friends encouraged
him to devote himself to the ministry. He went
with Mr. Simms, his pastor, to a commencement at
Cambridge, where he met Mr. Beverley, of Rowell,
and Mr. Beverley was the means of introducing him
to the people at Desborough; who, after hearing him
preach, gave him a unanimous invitation to become
their pastor, in the year 1657. He laboured successfully
amongst them during five years, when, on
the passing of "the Act of Uniformity," he gave up
the living, rather than comply with the terms required.</p>

<p>He then received an invitation to become the pastor
of the Church at Rowell, which had been under the
care of Mr. Beverley; and then the pious people at
Desborough united with those at Rowell to form one
society, under Mr. Browning's ministry. Though it
was a stormy day, and scenes of trial, opposition, and
suffering were before them, yet this worthy minister
undertook the charge, dwelt amongst them, and preached
the Gospel unto them; maintaining with great fervour
and clearness the doctrines of divine grace, with the
purity of God's worship, and the interests of holiness.
In these trying days, his labours were successful in
bringing, during his ministry at Rowell, about 135
persons to be united to the Church, many of whom
came from different places around. In the year 1684,
we have a brief statement in the records of the Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of this nature:&mdash;"From this time dates a sore persecution
and scattering which lay upon us, that we hardly
got together, much less obtained Church-meetings."
A note to this statement observes, "This proceeding
condemned afterwards by the Church." Again: "Kept
a night in prayer to God, humbling ourselves before
him. We partook of the Lord's Supper, and admitted
two members." So anxious were they to be faithful to
their God and to their principles in this time of trial.</p>

<p>Mr. Browning was for some time confined in Northampton
gaol for preaching the Gospel. From thence
he wrote several letters to his flock in different places
where they were resident. There is one published
addressed to the Church at Rowell, another to the
brethren of the Church at Broughton. From the
former we give the following extract, as showing Mr.
Browning's spirit, and the wise and pious counsels he
gave to his people.</p>

<p>He addresses them as "his dear brethren and beloved,"
and in one part of the letter observes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>You are under the awe of that word, Heb. x. 23&mdash;25. A
suffering day is the trial of our love to Christ. When there is
no opposition it is easy. Do not hypocrites do so? But this
is the commendation of Christ's followers; they "follow him
whithersoever he goeth." "These are they that came out of
great tribulation; they are before the throne, and serve him
night and day; and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell
among them; the Lamb in the midst of the throne shall feed
them, and shall wipe away tears from their eyes." Come, my
brethren, you weep now. Our tender Father has a handkerchief
in his hand to wipe away our tears, ere long. Do not offend
with weeping; too many tears may defile. "Woman, why
weepest thou?" was our Lord's inquiry. Tears of joy become
the saints, and there is no danger in them; they will be
sure to drop into his bosom, and draw out, it may be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
like in him; for he rejoices over us with singing, he rests in
his love. Oh, my brethren, methinks I am with you, weeping
with you, joying with you, praying with you, and hearing with
you. It is true fellowship my soul has with you at a distance.
I long after you much in the Lord; yet rejoicingly stay his
good pleasure. I would not come out a moment before his
time. I would not take a step without his direction. I am
wonderfully well, better and better. The cup of affliction for
the Gospel is sweeter, the deeper; a stronger cordial, the nearer
the bottom&mdash;I mean death itself. Oh the joy, unspeakable
and glorious, the dying martyrs of Jesus have had! How full
freight have been their souls in their passage to their port!
I tell you, if you knew what Christ's prisoners some of them
enjoyed in their gaols, you would not fear their condition, but
long for it; and I am persuaded, could their enemies conceive
of their comfort, in mere vexation of heart they would
stay their persecutions. "Therefore, my brethren, my joy, my
crown, stand fast in the Lord;" rejoice greatly to run your
race; fear not their fear; sit loose from the world; allot
yourselves this portion, that God has allotted you, "through
many tribulations to enter into the kingdom of heaven."
Come, the worst is death, and that is the best of all. What,
do we stick at dying for him, who stuck not at it for us? Do
we find difficulty in that, which will be an entrance into glory?
Do princes dread their coronation days? or any loath to come to
their nuptials? Foolish hearts! why do we err, not knowing,
rather, not believing the Scriptures? I must stay my pen to
dry my eyes, because of the overflowing of God's love upon
my soul. And now I see, if I had not something to keep me
down, I could not bear the loads of God's favour. Blessed be
God, blessed be God! "let every one that hath breath praise
the Lord." "Oh, love the Lord, ye his saints!" My brethren,
do not budge. Keep your ground: the Scripture is your law,
God is your king. Your principles are sober; your practices
are peaceable; your obedience to superiors known, in all
those things wherein your obedience is required. If men
have nothing against you but in the matters of your God,
rejoice and triumph in all your persecutions.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The following entry we find in the records of the
Church relating to the death of Mr. Browning:&mdash;Mr.
Thomas Browning, pastor of this Church, was gathered
to his Father's house in peace, in an evil, persecuting
day, May 9th, 1685, having served his Lord in this
house with much pains and many tears, with much
presence and success, about 23 years.</p>

<p>After this, trials pressed heavily upon them, so that
we are informed "the Church had but little communion
for some months, till God put it into our
hearts to humble ourselves, reform his house, and set
upon his work, almost lost by five or six years' persecution,
and the death of our pastor. We kept a
solemn day of prayer, April 22nd, 1686, with good
encouragement in it, by drawing out an account of
God's dealings with the souls of those following."
Then are given the names of seven persons admitted
to the Church. Others were added in subsequent
months of the same year; and admonitions were given
to those who had fallen back for fear of persecution.</p>

<p>After an interval of four years, when a great and
momentous change had taken place in the government
and in the prospects of England, by the accomplishment
of the glorious revolution by William, Prince of
Orange; and when, by the passing of the "Act of
Toleration," Nonconformists could no longer be persecuted
according to law&mdash;a measure which our forefathers
hailed with great joy, and which made a great
change from their former condition&mdash;the Church at
Rowell heard of the piety and talents of Mr. Richard
Davis, who was a member of a Church in London of
which Mr. Thomas Cole was pastor. Mr. Davis came
to them on probation, and they highly approved of his
services&mdash;desired him to obtain his dismission from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Church of which he was a member, that he might be
received amongst them; and then they invited him to
take the pastoral oversight of them, which invitation
he willingly accepted. The account of his ordination
is given in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>On the seventh day, March 22nd, 1689, the said Richard
Davis, by fasting and prayer of the Church, and imposition
of the hands of the eldership in the name of the said Church,
was set apart to and installed in the office of pastor or bishop
of the said Church of Christ at Rowell; being the answer of
many prayers of the said Church. The neighbouring Churches
were made acquainted with their design, and sent to, that
they might be present by their messengers to behold their
faith and order; but when they saw how it was to proceed,
several of the neighbouring ministers withdrew, saying, there
was no business for them.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this the Church at Rowell, with their pastor,
proceeded according to what they considered to be the
primitive model; but it was different to the practice
of the Churches around them, and the pastors coming
only to be spectators of their proceedings was by no
means pleasing to them; hence they appear not to have
looked with a very favourable eye on Mr. Davis, or on
the subsequent proceedings of his Church.</p>

<p>Mr. Davis was born in Cardiganshire, in South
Wales, in 1658; had a liberal education in his own
country; and after some years removed to London,
where he rose to such attainments in literature, that
he was looked upon as well qualified to fill the office
of master in a general school in the great city; and for
several years he continued in a laborious and faithful
discharge of its duties. He became a man of earnest,
consistent piety.</p>

<p>In the first part of his acquaintance with divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
things he sought an interview with Dr. Owen&mdash;with
Christian kindness he was received. The Doctor inquired
of him, "Young man, pray after what manner
do you think to go to God?" Mr. Davis answered,
"Sir, through the Mediator." To which the Doctor
replied, "Young man, that is easily said; but I do
assure you that it is another thing to go to God
through the Mediator indeed than perhaps many men,
who make use of the expression, are aware of. I
myself preached Christ some years when I had but
very little, if any, experimental acquaintance with
access to God through Christ, until the Lord was
pleased to visit me with sore affliction, whereby I was
brought to the mouth of the grave, and under which
my soul was oppressed with horror and darkness; but
God graciously relieved my soul in the powerful application
of Psalm cxxx. 4, "But there is forgiveness
with thee, that thou mayest be feared;" from whence
I received special instruction, peace, and comfort in
drawing near to God through the Mediator, and
preached thereupon immediately after my recovery."
So free was this great man of God in communicating
to others what he had felt, which, with other suitable
remarks then made, was of great use to Mr. Davis,
who, resolving to follow the Lord fully, made a profession
of his faith in Christ, and became united to a
Congregational Church. He was soon after urged to
devote himself to Christ in the ministry of the Gospel.
He began to preach, and "with that savour of spirit,"
it is said, "that warmth of soul, that zeal and judgment,
that those who heard were amazed, and glorified
God in him." Leaving the advantages of London, he
came down to Rowell and became the pastor of this
Church. He entered upon his work here with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
earnestness of spirit, and pursued it with great and
untiring energy. But the methods he adopted were
very different to those which generally prevailed
amongst the regular pastors of the day. Such was
the ardour of his zeal that he could not confine himself
within the bounds of the congregation that met
at Rowell, or to the places immediately around them.
His course of labour somewhat resembled that of
Bunyan, of whom it is said, "that he took the whole
circuit of Bedfordshire, and some neighbouring counties,
for his diocese." But Mr. Davis did not confine
these services for the diffusion of divine truth to his
own personal ministry, but he called out and employed
the brethren in the Church who were considered to be
endowed with suitable gifts and attainments in the
knowledge of the Gospel, to go and preach the word
of the Lord in places that were destitute of a Gospel
ministry. He employed what is denominated "a lay
agency" to a considerable extent. There were many
in those days who were strictly observant of ecclesiastical
regularity, who thought none should preach but
those who were educated for the work and ordained to
the office. The proceedings of Mr. Davis gave great
offence to such, and they severely censured this part
of his procedure. The view which he took of the
subject, and which he promoted among his people, is
thus stated in the records of the Church:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>The Church unanimously agreed, that though human learning
was good in its place, yet it was not essentially necessary
in the qualifications of any to be sent forth to preach the
Gospel; and the Church unanimously agreed, that a Church
of Christ had power within itself to choose, approve of, ordain,
or send forth any to preach the Gospel, either by virtue of
office, or otherwise in a probationary way in order to office,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
without calling in the assistance of the officers or elders of
other Churches to approve with them, unless at any time
they thought it necessary to desire their assistance by way of
advice.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hence the Gospel was preached, to a large extent,
by the pastor and some of the members of the Church
at Rowell. Considerable numbers were brought from
different places to become united to that Church.
Those who were too distant to attend regularly the
Sabbath services at Rowell, held meetings for prayer
and religious intercourse where they resided; sometimes
having the Lord's Supper administered to them,
and sometimes attending with the united Church at
Rowell. In some places this gave rise to another
Church being formed, when the numbers were sufficient
to sustain an interest, and to have a pastor of
their own; this was the case at Wellingborough, Ringstead,
Kimbolton, &amp;c. It is said that the members of
the Church have come to Rowell a distance of 20
miles and more, travelling with lighted lanterns part
of the way on the winter mornings, and in the same
manner on their return in the evening.</p>

<p>An interesting account is preserved of the method
adopted, when the members that resided in Wellingborough
and its vicinity were dismissed from the
Church at Rowell, to be formed into another Church
of the same order meeting at Wellingborough.</p>

<blockquote><p>There were dismissed from us these following, to build a
Church for Christ at Wellingborough, which dismission ran
in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whereas it is the appointed way of the Lord Jesus (as it
may be evidently manifest and deduced from the primitive
practice), when Churches are growing too big and unwieldy
to answer the ends of communion comfortably, and suitable
to the design of Congregational societies, that they then divide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and multiply into more Churches, whereby the Gospel as to its
faith, order, and worship, may come to be spread, propagated,
and commended to many dark places and corners, by multiplying
the golden candlesticks that are properly to hold forth
the light thereof; the work of conversion, and the great
method divinely appointed for gathering in the flock of God,
may be most ably managed; the comfort and establishment
of the saints by instruction and exhortation, with the due
exercise of authority, and mutual holy watch and care, may
be more effectually carried on; the conveniences of believers,
their families and neighbours, most charitably consulted and
provided for; and antichrist working in its various invented
forms of Churches, as diocesan, provincial, national, patriarchal,
and catholic, as under one universal pastor and pope,
fully prevented: this Church therefore of the living God, that
chiefly assembles at Rowell, has declared over and again this
to be their judgment, that when any of those dear brethren
and sisters that live remotely from Rowell increase into a
complete number, so as to be able to answer the ends of their
dividing and inchurching, and to bear the weight of those
duties incumbent on a particular independent Church of
Christ (in all which there must be high living by faith in
the Lord Jesus), that this Church of Christ will not only consent
to their dividing for to inchurch apart, but have declared
it is their duty so to do. Hereupon, after the Lord Jesus
having increased this Church of Christ into a great number
through his mighty blessing, and especially that branch of
them that lives in and near Wellingborough, our dearly beloved
brethren and sisters there and thereabouts have requested
us to dismiss them from us for this end, that they
might incorporate into a Church distinctly and apart from
us, and independent of us; we, therefore, by virtue of power
and authority leagued by the Lord Jesus amongst us, with
our officers, by the present do (they having first acknowledged
their faith and oneness with us in the faith and order
of the Gospel) dismiss our dearly beloved brethren (then
follow the names of the brethren), and also with the like
proviso dismiss our dearly beloved sisters (then follow the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
names of the female members), for that aforementioned end
of incorporating together as an Independent Church; declaring
that these, or any of these, as then actually dismissed
from us, that same moment they actually incorporate by actually
covenanting with the Lord and one another in the presence
of messengers delegated and appointed by us for that
affair, and not another&mdash;and those of them that do not at first
covenant, shall be deemed still members of us till they actually
covenant with that body; but do then declare them
dismissed from us, and give our consent for them so to do,
when they shall so covenant. Now, committing them to the
Lord Jesus, to be blessed with the blessings of the upper and
nether springs, and with all manner of spiritual blessings in
Christ Jesus our Lord, that they may multiply and increase
accordingly to many hundreds, and be fed and watered every
moment by the Lamb in the midst of the throne, we do in
testimony of this our letter of dismission put our names."</p>

<p>(There were included in this dismission 27 brethren, 45
sisters.)</p></blockquote>

<p>A certain gentleman once asked Mr. Davis "what
business he had to go up and down babbling?" for so
he called the preaching of the Gospel. Mr. Davis, in
the presence of all, turned to him, and, with a countenance
which testified a good cause and a good conscience,
said, "Sir, I was upon the work of my Lord
and Master, Jesus Christ. Do you know him?"
Whereupon the gentleman was struck with silence,
and many more with amazement.</p>

<p>The preaching of Mr. Davis, we suppose, must have
been very fervent and affectionate, calculated to a very
considerable degree to work upon the passions. It was
probably in connexion with this that some disorders
arose in their public assemblies. Some females became
hysterical, and cried out; and various indications
of strongly excited feeling were manifest for a time;
and numerous cases of affliction, many of them nervous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
disorders, appeared amongst them. These things being
noised abroad, and exaggerated, caused some reproach.</p>

<p>The subject is thus noticed in the records of the
Church:&mdash;"Feb. 17th, 1691, a day was kept solemnly
by fasting and prayer for the afflicted, where Satan
raged extremely; and the faith of God's children was
by the uplifted arm of the mighty God of Jacob made
to rise proportionably, to the praise of the glory of
God in Christ; and since that day, through the goodness
of God, the distemper has much abated on several,
as a testimony that our God is the God hearing prayer
in Zion." Again: "May 23rd, 1691, was a day kept
solemnly in fasting and prayer for the afflicted, when
God was eminently present; and at the close of the
day some of our brethren, naming the awful name of
Jesus of Nazareth, brought several of them to themselves,
to our great amazement, and as an earnest to
encourage our faith that that glorious name ere long
will make them perfectly whole." Again: "June 31st,
1691, was kept, the greatest part of the day, solemnly
in prayer for the afflicted, for the discovery of any
secret mystery of iniquity, if any was at work in reference
to them; and for the more clear discovery of the
matter of Thomas Haley, because it had been such a
thorn in the flesh of this Church of Christ."&mdash;We present
these extracts to show that there was something
rather peculiar in the state of the Church at this time,
and in the view they took of the circumstances that
arose.</p>

<p>As a specimen of the spirit of the times we may
state, that there was a pamphlet published by the
opposers of Mr. Davis, entitled, 'A plain and just
Account of a most horrid and dismal Plague begun at
Rowell, alias Rothwell, in Northamptonshire, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
hath infected many places round about; or, a faithful
Narrative of the execrable and noisome Errors, and
abominable and damnable Heresies, vented by Richard
Davis, pretended pastor to a people at Rowell, and by
his emissaries, the shoemakers, joiners, dyers, taylors,
weavers, farmers, &amp;c.; together with a brief account
1. Of his and his parties' practices; 2. Visions and revelations;
3. Great boasts; 4. Admission of members
into their society; 5. His people's self-condemnedness;
6. The number and quality of his hearers' admired fits;
7. Some queries to the country people as matter for
further search; 8. An expostulation and advice to the
people of Rowell. By Mr. P. Rehakosht, &amp;c., inhabiting
on the east side of the seat of the Plague. London:
printed for the Author, 1692.' Whoever this author
might be, the spirit of his work reflects far greater
discredit on himself than any of its charges do on the
pastor and his flock. Mr. Davis condescended to
reply, and near the close of his pamphlet we find the
following noble passage:</p>

<blockquote><p>If there be any errors I maintain, I care not how soon they
fall, though I fell with them; nay, if I could be convinced
that I erroneously worded any matter, I should soon publicly
declare against my own wording. It is not my own honour I
seek, but the honour of him that sent me; and I hope I am
always ready to bury my own honour in shame, provided I
could secure thereby his name from dishonour and contempt.
I should think hard of no confession of mine that should give
glory to God. But if it be the truth of Christ I am assaulted
for (as thereto I am persuaded it is), then all the attempts
against it will be in vain: his truth is like himself&mdash;eternal,
and will abide steadfast, bright, and insuperable, when I and
my opposers are moulded to dust and ashes. In parting, I
shall again recommend to them Gamaliel's prudent advice,
viz., to let us alone; for if this council be not of God, it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
fall of itself; but if it be of God, it shall stand in spite of all
their rage and persecution, and they themselves will at last be
found fighters against God.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Davis had to pass through a large measure of
censure and rebuke from his brethren. Intelligence
was conveyed to the London ministers of Mr. Davis's
very disorderly proceedings in sending out the members
of his Church to preach; also, respecting disorders
in the assemblies, and some reports of erroneous
doctrine, as if he were approaching Antinomianism.
Remonstrances were sent down to him. Mr. Davis
stood upon his defence. He was harshly treated; and
being of an ardent temperament, some things would be
done and said by him that the prudent would not justify.
A public controversy arose. Pamphlets were
published on both sides; and neither side, perhaps,
could be considered blameless in the matter. That
there were some eccentricities in the case of Mr. Davis,
and some incautious expressions, every impartial person
we suppose would allow; but the spirit of fervent
piety, the ardent attachment to the doctrines of divine
grace, combined with a deep sense of the obligations
to Christian holiness, and some eminent attainments in
the divine life, with great labours, and much success,
commend Mr. Davis to the grateful remembrance of all
the friends of truth and piety.</p>

<p>The following testimony was borne to the sentiments
and preaching of Mr. Davis, by the members of
the Church at Rowell:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>We, the members of the Church of Christ over which Mr.
R. Davis is pastor, and his constant hearers, having seriously
considered the principles laid to his charge, do declare and
testify they are utterly false, and that the current of his doctrine
has been as he himself has laid it down. And further,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the design of his preaching amongst us has been to offer pardoning
grace, through the blood of Christ, freely to sinners;
to press them to accept thereof on pain of damnation; to
press us to holiness, from the principle of saving faith; to
advance the person and offices of the Lord Jesus&mdash;likewise, the
person, offices, graces, and gifts of the Spirit; and likewise, to
advance electing grace reigning through the righteousness of
Christ Jesus. We also attest, that all those evil practices laid
to his charge, and especially the ridiculous falsehoods about
admissions, are abominable untruths;&mdash;whereunto we have
subscribed our names at the general Church-meeting, it being
a solemn day of fasting and prayer.</p>

<p>(Signed by 40 brethren, members of the Church.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The authors of the 'History of Dissenters' state:
"With all his peculiarities and extravagancies, which
were probably increased by the unkind and bitter opposition
of his brethren, Richard Davis appears to have
been a very pious man, and an extraordinary zealous
minister of Christ. From some occasional sermons
of his which were published, it is plainly seen that he
must have been remarkably popular. There is a simplicity,
an animation, and a pungency in them, which,
if seconded by a suitable elocution, must have made
a powerful impression on the hearts of his hearers.
His zeal was of the most ardent kind; and England
at that time, perhaps, scarcely could produce a man
of more ardent labours in the Redeemer's cause. Not
satisfied with performing the duties of the pastoral
office to his flock at Rowell, he added the character
of an itinerant too, and extended his journeys 80
miles in every direction around the place of his abode.
His converts became members of his Church; and as
they lived at a distance, and could only attend on particular
occasions, they had religious meetings among
themselves for prayer, for conversation, for preaching,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
as opportunities were afforded. That they might enjoy
these in the greatest abundance, he called forth the
most intelligent members of the Church into action, and
employed them in itinerating within his extensive circle.</p>

<p>"Of these lay preachers, whom Mr. Davis sent out,
several afterwards became pastors of Churches, formed
from the societies which he had collected in the towns
and villages in which he was wont to preach. To the
honour of Mr. Davis it may be mentioned, that he
had imbibed a principle, the want of which at that
time was exceedingly injurious to the cause of religion,
and circumscribed within narrow limits the usefulness
of many excellent men&mdash;it may be named the
principle of propagation. On this principle did Mr.
Davis act, and he united in himself the office and character
of pastor, itinerant, and primitive bishop, presiding
over his humble presbyters who aided him in the
labours of his diocese. While we throw a veil of compassion
over his infirmities, it must give pleasure to
every friend of religion to witness the fervour of his
zeal, and the multiplicity of his labours, to extend the
knowledge of Christ as far as his exertions could
possibly reach. Let posterity give to his memory the
praise which is justly due, and hail Richard Davis as
the morning star of propagation."&mdash;<i>History of Dissenters</i>,
vol. i. p. 396.</p>

<p>In the year 1691 deaconesses were chosen to act in
this Church. Though this is not a general practice
now in the Churches, it is still thought by many
learned men that there are references to such appointments
in the writings of the apostles. Phebe is
considered to have been a deaconess of the Church at
Cenchrea; and those whose qualifications the Apostle
points out in his letter to Timothy, which our translators<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
understood to be the wives of the deacons, are
thought by many to be persons appointed to this office,
"deaconesses."</p>

<p>Mr. Davis died in the 56th year of his age. When
constant prevailing indisposition made it evident that
his end was drawing nigh, the mutual affection expressed
between him and the Church of which he was
pastor was very remarkable. He would say to them
with the greatest tenderness, "I die, but God will
surely visit you;" while he would wrestle in prayer
on their behalf, that the great Shepherd would take
care of them in the wilderness. And their cries
ascended to heaven for his stay amongst them; and
floods of tears did they pour out to their heavenly
Father on this occasion. But the time was come
when he must die. His work was done; he must be
called to his rest. Under date of September 10th,
1714, we have the following record:&mdash;"Mr. Richard
Davis, pastor, after he had faithfully, with hard
labour and travail, through many and great difficulties,
slanders, reproaches, and persecutions, for about five-and-twenty
years, served the Lord in this house,
he was taken to rest, and to receive the crown of
glory."</p>

<p>About a month previous to this, it was concluded at
a Church-meeting to invite Mr. Maurice as an assistant
to Mr. Davis. On the death of Mr. Davis, Mr.
Maurice was invited to the pastoral office, which
invitation he accepted, and was solemnly set apart to
the office in the presence of messengers from other
Churches, with fasting and prayer, on the 6th of
January, 1715.</p>

<p>Mr. Maurice was a native of Wales; a member of
one of the Churches in the principality; by them called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
to the ministry; settled for a time at Olney, in
Buckinghamshire, and from thence removed to Rowell.
The ministry of Mr. Maurice, in this situation, was
continued for nearly 24 years, as he died at Rowell,
1738. He was a laborious and successful preacher of
the Gospel; and his pen was employed in expounding
and enforcing divine truth, and in illustrating the
great principles of Congregational Church polity and
the social influence of religion. The congregation
continued to be large and increasing, so that on May
29th, 1734, it is recorded, "A talk concerning, and
some subscriptions towards, enlarging the Meeting
House, if the Lord will." And it appears that the
present Meeting House was built in the course of the
next year; for Mr. Maurice published a sermon from
Psalm cxxii. 4, entitled, 'The tribes of the Lord
appearing before him; or, families in public worship:
a Sermon preached at the Opening of the new Meeting
House at Rowell, November 9th, 1735.' Near the
close of the discourse Mr. Maurice observes,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>With regard to the place, where now for the first time we
are met to worship the Lord, if it is possible in any sense for
the stone to cry out of the wall, and the beam in the timber
to answer it; if stones can speak, as our Lord said they
would, if the children of men held their peace&mdash;then God has
a voice in this work of his providence, which the man of wisdom
will hear.</p>

<p>It calls upon us to bless the Lord for our established liberty
of conscience, and for the amazing methods Providence made
use of to procure, continue, and confirm it. Our fathers were
glad to meet together in woods, deserts, and desolate places,
for the worship of God, as much as they could out of the way
of barbarous, cruel, and bloody informers; and yet were often
hunted out and found by these servants of the powers of darkness,
and put in prisons and dungeons for the sake of the truth&mdash;their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
families deprived of the necessaries of life by merciless
and terrible fines and seizures: but, blessed be the Lord for
the Revolution! and may the glorious and immortal memory
of King William be in great esteem by all the Churches of
Christ; and among them let us, let our children, and their
children's children bear a part, in high praises to the God of
tender providence at the remembrance of deliverances and enlargements
past; and through the same tender mercies conveyed
to us, and we hope to be continued to the end of time,
may we be helped to make the best use and improvement of
our liberty in all religious zeal for the faith and worship of
our Redeemer; in sincere evangelical love to each other; and
on all occasions in cheerful acknowledgments of duty to that
illustrious family under whose wings it is preserved to us, by
the providence of the Most High.</p>

<p>And we are called to own His grace who giveth the everlasting
Gospel, and gathereth poor sinners under the sound of it,
making our assemblies so numerous as to stand in need of so
large a place; and thankful we should be to the same Almighty
hand for giving capacity, and a willing mind, to so many of us
to contribute cheerfully to the charge. We hope generations
to come will bless God for this; and as for us, we must say as
David did: "What are we, that we should be able to offer so
willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of
thine own have we given thee." The generous assistance of
our friends in London and elsewhere I hope we shall always
thankfully acknowledge, and own the bountiful hand of our
God therein; and I can never, without being deeply affected,
relate or think of the extraordinary kindness of a religious
family, descended from one of the godly elders first fixed in
this Church of Christ. What things does our God treasure
up in his providence! Nor should we forget to be thankful
to the Lord, who, through all the work, though attended with
many difficulties and some dangers, mercifully preserved all
the persons concerned, so that without bruises or wounds they
can view their finished work.</p></blockquote>

<p>A controversy arose during the ministry of Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Maurice on the point, "Whether it was the duty of
unconverted sinners who heard the Gospel to believe
in Jesus Christ." Mr. Maurice was greatly concerned
that such a question should arise, and published
a small pamphlet, entitled, 'The Modern Question
modestly stated.' To this there was a reply published;
and then he wrote, 'The Modern Question confirmed
and proved,' viz., that the eternal God does by his
word make it the duty of poor unconverted sinners,
who hear the Gospel preached or published, to believe
in Jesus Christ.' This was not printed until after
Mr. Maurice's death, for it is said to be "by Matthias
Maurice, late pastor to a Church at Rowell, in Northamptonshire,
1739." It has an address to the reader
by Mr. Bradbury, of London, who says, "The author of
this work was a person whose learning, temper, and
piety, made him very dear to me. At his desire I
have perused and published these papers. He has
in his letters assured me of the great concern this
affair gave him, when a question of so much importance
to the work of ministers and the duty of mankind came
to be a matter of debate. The Church, to whom he
was an affectionate pastor, has lain under a reproach
which this book, and their desires to have it published,
will effectually roll away."</p>

<p>We introduce this work chiefly on account of a
statement it contains from the Church. Prefixed to
this little volume we find the following, signed by 52
of the brethren of the Church:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><div class="hanging"><i>The testimony of the Church of Christ at Rowell, against
the pernicious new opinion, at their Meeting, August
31st, 1737.</i></div>

<p>Whereas of late it has been stated, embraced, and maintained
by some, that God does nowhere in the Scripture make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
it <i>the duty</i> of poor unconverted sinners, who hear the Gospel
preached, to believe in Jesus Christ for salvation, we, the
Church of Christ at Rowell, being greatly concerned that God's
revealed will should be so daringly opposed, and earnestly
desirous that we, and our children, and all that name the
name of Christ, may for ever be delivered from such a pernicious
dangerous error, do in the most solemn manner, in the
presence of the great God and our Saviour, testify our abhorrence
thereof, and declare, that in the strength of Christ we
will contend earnestly for the doctrine of faith once delivered
to the saints, of which doctrine we look upon this to be a very
valuable part&mdash;that God does in his word make it <i>the duty</i>
of poor unconverted sinners who hear the Gospel preached, to
be truly concerned for their souls and believe in Jesus Christ
for salvation. The denial of this we look upon to be a denial
of the law of God, not to be borne with in an orderly Church,
and attended with dangerous consequences against the Gospel
and all the life and power of evangelical, practical religion.
Wherefore, what God delivered to our fathers, and what our
fathers in his fear delivered down to us, we think ourselves
bound in conscience to deliver to our children; namely, that
God does command unconverted sinners to repent and believe
in his Son for everlasting salvation; and may our children
deliver this with greater zeal, and with most desirable success,
to following generations. Amen.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Maurice published a volume entitled, 'Faith
Encouraged'; 'Faith working by Love&mdash;Four Sermons
on 1 John iii. 23;' 'Monuments of Mercy; or, Some of
the distinguishing Favours of Christ to his Congregational
Church at Rowell;' also, a sermon on 'The help
of the Holy Spirit in prayer.' But his most interesting
and useful work we consider to be, 'Social Religion
Exemplified, in several Dialogues, giving an account of
the first Settlement of Christianity in the city of Caerludd,
and of the administration of the ordinances and
discipline of the Gospel in the Church there planted:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
with the remarkable success with which Christ blessed
his own institutions to the recovering of its backsliding
members, the satisfaction of those who were under
spiritual distresses, and the edification and comfort of
the whole Society;&mdash;in which many cases of conscience
are judiciously answered.' This is a copy of the title-page
of the first edition, 1740. It appears that this
work came out in separate parts, and that the whole was
not published until some time after the death of Mr.
Maurice.</p>

<p>There were 134 members of the Church when
Mr. Maurice died.</p>

<p>The next pastor was Mr. Jonathan Sanderson. Application
was first made to Mr. Wheeler, of Axminster,
in Devonshire, who came and preached to them four
Sabbaths, but entirely declined all thoughts of settling
with them. After this, Mr. Job Orton was invited;
but he declined accepting the invitation. Then application
was made to Mr. Sanderson, who promised to
come and assist them for three or four Sabbaths, when
he had finished his studies with Mr. Eames. After a
trial he was invited to become their pastor; when he
thought the call of God so clear and plain, that he
could not refuse complying with it, though considerable
offers, more to his temporal advantage, were made to
him. In May, 1741, he was set apart to the office.
He gives the following account of the solemnity:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>On this day, the Church renewed their call to me to take
upon me the pastoral charge of them under the great Shepherd.
Upon that, after having given the Church a particular account
of my faith, publicly declared my acceptation of their call to
the pastoral office, I gave up myself in a solemn manner to
the great work they had called me to. Ebenezer.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>On June 3rd of the same year we had a day of prayer appointed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and invited several sister Churches in communion
with us to join in seeking a blessing upon us as a Church,
and upon my poor labours amongst them.</p>

<p>Dr. Doddridge spake to the people, and Mr. Hall, of London,
gave me a word of exhortation upon the occasion.</p></blockquote>

<p>The ministry of Mr. Sanderson was devoted and
useful, but short. Only six years after the time of his
settlement we find it recorded, "Mr. Jonathan Sanderson
fell sweetly asleep in Christ Jesus, April 18th,
1747."</p>

<p>When he entered on his office, and transcribed the
names of those that were then members of the Church,
he wrote&mdash;"The Lord grant that the Church of Christ
at Rowell may increase in numbers, gifts, and graces,
and purity, under the pastoral care of their unworthy
servant, for Christ's sake, J. S. So be it. Amen."
38 members were added to the Church during his short
ministry.</p>

<p>Mr. Sanderson was a native of Bradfield, a village
about eight miles from Sheffield, in Yorkshire. He
became early devoted to God, and dedicated himself
sincerely to the work of the sanctuary. In the year 1737,
when about 19 years of age, he entered a seminary in
London, patronized by the Independent Fund, then
under the direction of Mr. Eames, F.R.S., who, in the
esteem of his contemporaries, was one of the most
learned men of the age. The piety of Mr. Sanderson
when at the academy appears to have been of
the most decided, humble, evangelical, and experimental
character. His preaching was very acceptable
and useful, so that opportunities were presented to him
to have settled in London, and he was advised by some
of the ministers of his acquaintance to do so; but he
yielded to the invitation of the people at Rowell, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
believed that he saw plainly the finger of God pointing
him there. He was received with much kindness and
cordiality, and was greatly encouraged in the prospect
of usefulness there presented. He was welcomed into
the county by Dr. Doddridge, who addressed to him
the following letter, almost immediately after he came
to Rowell:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Permit me, my dear brother and friend&mdash;for so, though personally
unknown, I will take the liberty to call you; permit
me, with the utmost sincerity and pleasure, to assure you of
my thankfulness to the great Shepherd of Israel for bringing
you into these parts, to be employed among us, and under
him, in the delightful work of feeding his flock, his pleasant
flock.</p>

<p>I rejoice to hear by many hands of the acceptance you meet
with at Rowell, and of the respect you have of neighbouring
brethren and friends, who are so happy as to be at all acquainted
with you; respect, which I fully concluded from the
manner of your writing (in which I saw at once so much of
the gentleman, the scholar, and the Christian) you could not
fail to meet with in these parts, where, I bless God, we are not
utterly forsaken of the spirit of serious piety and faithful
friendship. Were not my engagements so many as they are,
and now increasing by the care of finishing my 'Expositor' as
soon as possible, I would have waited upon you before this.
But I send these to beg the favour of you to breakfast with
me at Mr. Saul's, at Kettering, Thursday se'nnight, if God
spare our lives till then; and to contrive your affairs so as to
go with me from thence to Wellingborough, where I shall dine
that day, if God permit. By this means I shall have the
pleasure of enjoying your company, and also of introducing
you to the acquaintance of a friend or two there, with whom,
if you do not yet know, it will be agreeable to you to form an
acquaintance, or if you do know them, to improve that acquaintance.</p>

<p>I desire you would make my cordial service acceptable to
all my dear friends at Rowell, for whom I have an unfeigned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and tender regard; and assure yourself that I have all imaginable
propensity to enter into a free, easy, and respectful
friendship with you; and that, heartily recommending you to
Him in whom, I hope, our friendship does and will centre,</p>

<div class="center">I am, Reverend and dear Sir,</div>
<div class="signature2">Your most affectionate brother and humble servant,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">P. Doddridge.</span></div>
<p>
<i>Northampton, March 16th, 1740.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Sanderson commenced his labours at Rowell
with great diligence and zeal; tokens of the divine
blessing attended his labours. But his frame appears
to have been too feeble to sustain the amount of labour
in which he engaged, and it was not very long before
symptoms of an unfavourable nature were discovered.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the great affection manifested towards
him at first, and the encouraging prospect opening
before him, trials soon arose among his people.
There were some whose spirit and conduct had been
the occasion of painful trial to his predecessor, Mr.
Maurice; and they began, but too quickly, to show a
similar spirit towards him: those who denied the
Gospel call to sinners as such, and who wanted all the
privileges of Christianity without its obligations. Some
of them soon withdrew their subscriptions from him,
and talked of building a new Meeting. There was
a worthy deacon of his Church, who stood firmly by
him, and who wrote a very sensible letter, kindly and
faithfully expostulating with them on their conduct; in
the course of which he observes, "We are not without
several sad instances which have fallen under our own
cognizance, of Churches who, upon ceasing to contribute
to a handsome maintenance of their pastor what was
in their power, without injury to their families, have
gradually dwindled and come to nothing. The reason
of this, we apprehend, is very obvious; for when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Churches cease to walk in the path of duty, the blessed
God is pleased to suspend the influence of his grace,
and to visit them with his afflictive hand. We are not
arguing for a superfluity, for that you are incapable
of doing; but only for a proper expression of love and
kindness to your pastor," &amp;c.</p>

<p>Mr. Sanderson proved to be consumptive, and gradually
grew worse, until he was removed by death in the
29th year of his age.</p>

<p>Dr. Doddridge was amongst the number that visited
him in his last illness; and after his visit he wrote a
kind letter to the father of Mr. Sanderson, in which
he says, "Greatly have I loved him and esteemed him,
as one of the most completely excellent and accomplished
persons of his age that I have ever known.
Greatly has God honoured him, as the instrument of usefulness,
during these few years of ministerial service."</p>

<p>After the death of Mr. Sanderson, a friend wrote&mdash;"Poor
Rowell lies in sackcloth. Oh, that she might
know in this her day the things that make for her
peace! They have my best wishes and earnest prayers
that the Lord, the God of the spirits of all flesh, may
find out a man to stand in the gap, and fill up the
breach which he has so awfully made, that the congregation
of the Lord may not be as sheep which have
no shepherd."</p>

<p>In the year 1741 Dr. Doddridge published two
sermons, the substance of which had been delivered at
Rowell&mdash;'The Scripture doctrine of Salvation by
Grace through Faith, illustrated and improved.' In
an address prefixed to these discourses to the Church
and congregation of Protestants at Rowell he says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>I cannot conclude this short address without congratulating
you on the abundant goodness of God to you as a Church, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
bringing among you that worthy and excellent person, Mr.
Sanderson, under whose pastoral care you are now so happily
placed. I know he is a faithful witness to the truths of the
Gospel, and rejoice in that rich abundance of gifts and graces
which renders him so fit to state and improve them in the
most advantageous as well as the most agreeable and delightful
manner. I hope and believe that the grace he so humbly
owns his dependence upon will add happy success to his
labours; and I heartily pray that you and neighbouring
Churches may long be happy in him, and that God, who has
by such various and gracious interpositions in your favour
expressed his paternal care of you, may still delight to dwell
among you.</p></blockquote>

<p>Shortly after the death of Mr. Sanderson, Mr. Moses
Gregson was chosen, with great unanimity, to the pastoral
office. His ordination took place April 20th, 1748.
Upon this occasion, the service was conducted in the
method generally adopted in other Dissenting Churches.
Dr. Doddridge asked the usual questions, and took the
confession of faith; Mr. King, of London, preached to
the people; and Dr. Guyse gave the charge.</p>

<p>Mr. Gregson continued pastor for about forty years.
During the course of his ministry 88 members were
admitted to the Church. When years increased and
infirmities came on, so as to render him incapable of
discharging all the duties of his office, Mr. John Wood
was invited to become co-pastor with Mr. Gregson;
but before Mr. Wood entered on this office, the death
of Mr. Gregson took place. In consequence of this
change Mr. Wood was invited to become the pastor of
the Church, which he accepted, and was set apart
to the office in September, 1789; when Mr. Smith,
of Bedford, delivered the introductory discourse;
Mr. Wood, of Creaton, offered the ordination
prayer; Mr. Horsey, of Northampton, delivered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
charge; and Mr. Toller, of Kettering, preached to
the people.</p>

<p>No records are preserved of the pastorate of Mr.
Wood, though it continued until March 25th, 1811, a
period of twenty-one years and six months, when
Mr. Wood resigned his office as pastor of the Church
at Rowell.</p>

<p>After an interval of two years, Mr. Walter Scott,
from Hoxton Academy, was set apart to the pastoral
office, on the 20th of May, 1813. On that occasion,
Mr. Whitehead, of Creaton, delivered the introductory
discourse; ordination prayer, Mr. Toller, of Kettering;
charge, Mr. Gill, of Harborough, from 2 Tim. iv. 22;
sermon, by Mr. Richards, from 1 Thess. v. 12, 13. In
the evening, Mr. Griffiths, of Long Buckby, preached
from Zech. vii. 25.</p>

<p>Mr. Scott's ministry was highly acceptable and useful,
distinguished by a great fulness and rich variety
of matter, and greatly valued through the county.
It continued for twenty years, until the year 1833,
during which period about 130 members were added
to the Church.</p>

<p>New school-rooms were erected in the front of the
front of the Chapel in the year 1826.</p>

<p>With his labours as pastor, Mr. Scott united the
duties of tutor. For several years he had under his
care a number of young men, most of whom were designed
for the ministry, in a course of preparatory
training, previous to their entering the Academy at
Hoxton, afterwards Highbury. His labours in this
department were considered to be eminently useful, so
as ultimately to raise him to a higher sphere as a
tutor.</p>

<p>In the year 1833 Mr. Scott received an invitation to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
become the resident Divinity Tutor of the College at
Airedale, near Bradford, Yorkshire, with which he at
length considered it his duty to comply. When it was
first presented to him, "he laid it before the Church,
desiring their advice and prayer. They unanimously
expressed their desire that he would remain with
them; and some of them did so in the strongest terms,
stating it as their conviction that he ought not by any
means to leave. After serious consideration, prayer
to the Divine Being, and asking the advice of several
ministers, he however came to the conclusion that it
was his duty to leave. The Church in general were
brought to say, "the will of the Lord be done."</p>

<p>Some idea may be formed of Mr. Scott's habits while
at Rowell, from a passage in an address delivered to the
students at Airedale, and published in the year 1835.
Recommending them in one part of it carefully to attend
to the preservation of their health, he says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>I would, in a special manner, recommend to you to take
regular, abundant, and systematic exercise. On this subject
I can speak with confidence, not only from observation, but
from experience of both the most painful and the most pleasant
kind. I assure you, that by neglecting exercise, by untimely
late hours, and immoderate study, I injured most seriously my
health. By systematic, determined, vigorous exercise, I have
banished disease, regained my health, and even increased the
vigour of both mind and body. Had it not been for exercise
and attention to diet, as the means in the hand of God, it is
my firm persuasion, rather it is with me matter of absolute
certainty, that, instead of being able in the possession of good
health to address you on this occasion, I should have been the
helpless victim of more diseases than one which had begun to
invade my frame; or rather, I should have been numbered with
the dead. I have observed several running the same course
which I had partly run, without having been arrested in it as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
I was; and the consequence has been, that though they were
younger than I was, and at one time quite as healthy, they
have years ago been consigned to the tomb.... I am
very much disposed to believe, or rather I have no doubt,
that, had the history of students and ministers in general been
accurately written, the way in which they have neglected their
health, entailed diseases on their frame, and shortened their
lives, would furnish some of the most striking instances on
record in the pages of history, of imprudence in those who
ought to be eminent for prudence, and of folly in those whose
office it is to teach wisdom to others. I have no doubt that
some early and apparently premature removals of eminent
ministers from this world, which have been thought to be
most mysterious and unaccountable dispensations of divine
providence, would be found to be the necessary result of their
own conduct, in neglecting some of the most obvious rules of
prudence for the preservation of their health. To have prevented
that removal, God must have wrought a miracle.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Scott is also the author of one of the volumes
of Congregational Lectures on 'The Existence and
Agency of Evil Spirits.'</p>

<p>After the removal of Mr. Scott, the Church at
Rowell was supplied by several ministers, for some
time remaining unsettled. On the 5th of October,
1836, Mr. Gallsworthy, a student at Airedale, visited
Rowell, and preached for seven Sabbaths, when the
Church unanimously agreed to invite him to become
their pastor. This invitation he accepted; the ordination
service being held October 4th, 1837, when
Messrs. Toller, of Kettering, Hobson, of Welford, Scott,
late of Rowell, and Green, of Uppingham, were engaged
in the principal services of the day. The ministry of
Mr. Gallsworthy only continued until December 24th,
1841, when he left Rowell, and became minister to a
Church at Pinchbeck, in Lincolnshire. During his
ministry 60 members were added to the Church.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Some months after Mr. Gallsworthy had left Rowell,
the present minister, the Rev. Richard Jessop, from
Oldham, in Lancashire, accepted an invitation to the
pastoral office, and commenced his stated labours at
Rowell the 9th of October, 1842. Since that time
more than 60 members have been added to the Church.
A new school has been erected for the Infant Sabbath-school;
and at the present time considerable alterations
are about to be made in the Meeting House&mdash;re-pewing,
new roofing, and enlarging&mdash;at an expense
of from 700 to 800. The number of scholars in the
Sabbath-schools is 320. Six villages are supplied
with Sabbath evening services by the members of the
Church. Present number of communicants is 130.</p>

<p>In reviewing the history of a Church that has been
in existence now for nearly 200 years, what abundant
reason is there for full satisfaction with the great principles
on which it was founded, as agreeable to the
word of God, and the means of sustaining, under God,
the faithful ministry of the word of life, and the administration
of the ordinances of the Gospel in their
purity! Attached to the same principles, and exhibiting
their happy and holy influence, this Church of
Christ we trust will still go on and prosper&mdash;the great
Head of the Church attending it with his constant
presence and blessing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>MEMORIALS OF THE INDEPENDENT CHURCH AT
KETTERING.</h3>


<p>There are some places which present no claim on
public notice from anything remarkable in their situation,
their population, or their buildings; yet attain
celebrity from the character, talents, and services of
certain individuals that have been connected with
them. This is the case with the town of Kettering.
It is a comparatively small town, containing about
5,000 inhabitants, standing about the centre of the
northern division of the county of Northampton; but
this place has attained to some considerable degree of
renown, on account of the religious advantages with
which it has been favoured. By some persons it may
be thought of with interest, as the birth-place of Dr.
Gill and Mr. Brine, eminent ministers of the Gospel
in their day; but it is far more extensively known, as
the place where a Toller and a Fuller, though of different
denominations, laboured together in the same
cause during a space of more than thirty years. No
town probably, for its size, has been so distinguished,
by having two ministers, of such a high standing,
engaged for so long a period as stated pastors of two
societies. Their talents and attainments were of a different
order, but though different, equally eminent.
Fuller was most extensively known on account of his
services to the Baptist Mission, and his able and useful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
publications, whilst he was highly esteemed as a minister
of the Gospel&mdash;Toller, as a preacher of original
manner, and remarkable interest and power, was greatly
valued, and will be long remembered.</p>

<p>But for a considerable period we find the town of
Kettering distinguished by the faithful ministration of
Gospel truth. The Puritans, in 1591, are said to have
held several meetings here and in the neighbourhood.
Two hundred years ago, Mr. Thomas Maidwell, an
eminent minister of Christ, preached the Gospel here,
having become rector of the parish about the year
1650. Mr. Maidwell was a native of Geddington, a
village three miles from Kettering. He was educated
at Cambridge, became a good scholar, an excellent
preacher, and a man of eminent piety. In the year
1662 he was ejected from the living, and ranked
among the devoted Nonconformists of the day. After
his ejectment he frequently preached in his own house,
and in other houses in the town; until at length he
opened a Meeting House, which would hold from
300 to 400 hearers. In what year this took place is
unknown. He lived for thirty years after his separation
from the Church. Like many of his brethren
in those days, he was tried by persecution. One H.
Sawyer, Esq., a large landed proprietor in the parish,
was a bitter enemy to the Nonconformists, and often
tried to get Mr. Maidwell into his power. He frequently
escaped with difficulty, sometimes in disguise.
It is said that he was once cast into prison. He was
also banished from his home by the "Five Mile Act,"
retiring for some time from Kettering, it is supposed
to the house of H. Barwell, Esq.,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of Marston Trussell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
near Market Harborough. From thence he wrote
to his people at Kettering three very excellent pastoral
letters, which have been preserved. An extract from
the first of these will be sufficient to show something
of the principles and spirit of this minister of Christ.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">My dear Friends</span>: Grace and peace be multiplied.&mdash;Since
I heard of the great distress you are in on several accounts, it
cannot but much affect and afflict me; and the rather, because
my present dangers and sufferings add to yours, which
makes the burden heavier to us both. But if our God, who
directs, helps us to cast our burden on him, he will sustain it,
and us under it, as at present he doth, blessed be his name!
for though "we are troubled on every side, yet we are not
distressed; though perplexed, yet not in despair; though persecuted,
yet not forsaken; though cast down, yet not destroyed."
Though we bear in our outward man "the dying of the Lord
Jesus," yet if the life, spirit, and vigour of Christ be exercised
in our inward man, we shall live to him eternally hereafter,
as spiritually here. But the want of that divine vigour
and true Christian magnanimity fills most souls with despondency,
bowels with sighs, and tongues with complaints. Yet
we have no reason to murmur against or complain of our
God, who doth all things justly, and wisely, and well, but of
ourselves, who neither know, do, nor suffer as we ought; but
"in many things we offend all," and therefore all suffer justly.
It's true, you will say&mdash;what is to be done under our present
suffering?</p></blockquote>

<p>Then he goes on to give them most suitable and
important directions; such as, "Let every one search
his and her ways." "Let not self-examination be
superficial, but special, thorough, affectionate, heart-melting,
soul afflicting, extraordinary, becoming so
dark a day." "Press after a personal, relative, thorough
reformation of what is amiss in heart, tongue,
and life." "Have a daily vigorous recourse by a
lively faith unto Christ." "Let that faith, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
reality and eminence of it, be more and more manifested
in our new obedience." He gives them directions
as to the purity of their worship&mdash;their spirit
towards each other&mdash;their sitting loose to the world&mdash;giving
up themselves entirely to God&mdash;giving all
diligence in their Christian course&mdash;seeking to attain
joy and peace in believing&mdash;and then closes in these
words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Thus, my dear hearts, I have answered your desires in your
last I received; heartily letting you know, that though I am
absent in body from you to my great grief, yet I am present
with you in spirit, daily praying for you, longing to see you,
which I should have done "once and again had not Satan
hindered," which he will do till Christ comes and binds him
in chains and removes him out of the way, and gives his
people a quiet and full enjoyment of himself in each other.
Which, that he may, is the earnest prayer of your unworthy
pastor, solicitous for your souls' good.</p>

<div class="signature2">I am, Sirs, &amp;c.,</div>
<div class="signature">T. M.</div>
<p>Communicate this to ours.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is uncertain in what year the Church was formed,
as the first entry in the oldest Church-book is without
date. The following is the first statement: "An account
of the names of those who are in Church fellowship
at Kettering, and have engaged to walk together
according to the rules of the Gospel, under the ministry
of Mr. Maidwell, pastor there." Then follow
the names of 95 members residing in Kettering, and
91 in other places in the vicinity: total number of
members, 186.</p>

<p>The Church was formed on Congregational principles,
with a pastor, two elders, and two deacons.</p>

<p>Mr. Maidwell continued his labours almost to the
last, and died January 9th, 1692, about 80 years of
age. He was buried in the chancel of the parish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Church, a stone being placed over his grave, with a
Latin inscription, now scarcely legible.</p>

<p>We are informed that "he was abundant in labours;
never weary of his work, and seldom wearied in it:
that he had the happy art of winning souls to Christ;
that such was his peculiar aptitude for religious conversation,
making a spiritual improvement of all
earthly business and concerns he was engaged about,
that it was considered a question, whether he did more
good or converted more souls in the pulpit or out of
it. He had an amiable temper, and breathed much of
the spirit of his Divine Master, recommending continually
the Gospel he preached by his lovely and consistent
deportment." One "of whom the world was not
worthy," but whose "memory is blessed." "He was
a burning and shining light, and there were many
who rejoiced to walk in his light."</p>

<p>After the death of Mr. Maidwell, Mr. Thomas Milway
became pastor of the Church. The date of his
settlement is not given, but it is supposed to have
taken place between January, 1692, and June, 1694.
It is supposed that he came from Bury to Kettering. His
pastorate was but a short one, not more than four or
five years. At the commencement of his ministry the
Church numbered 167 members, and 61 were added
while he was pastor. In the list of members at the
commencement of Mr. Milway's labours, we find the
name of John Gill, the father of the celebrated Dr.
Gill, and the name of Elijah Brine, father of Mr.
William Brine, a Baptist minister of some eminence,
contemporary with Dr. Gill.</p>

<p>About the year 1696, Mr. William Wallis, a ruling
elder in the Church, embraced the sentiments of the
Baptists, and took upon him to baptize by immersion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
some of the members of the Church. This being
brought forward in a Church assembly, in which it is
said "to have been proved that he had no right or
power to do so," he desired his dismission, which was
granted him; after which he began to preach in
another place in the town; and six or seven of the
members, embracing the same sentiments, left the
Church with Mr. Wallis, and thus he became the first
pastor of the Baptist Church in Kettering.</p>

<p>From the parish register it is found that Mr. Milway
was buried April 3rd, 1697.</p>

<p>In the 'Nonconformist Memorial,' mention is made
of a Mr. Shepherd, as succeeding Mr. Maidwell at
Kettering; but the evidence presented by the register
of Mr. Shepherd's burial at Kettering shows that
he must have immediately succeeded Mr. Milway,
and that his labours here only continued for a few
months, for he was buried March 21st, 1698. No
account of his services is preserved in the records
of this Church. We are informed that "he was a
minister in the Established Church at Tilbrook, in
Bedfordshire. When the "Bartholomew Act" passed,
at first he conformed; continuing for some years in
his living, a great blessing to the town and neighbourhood.
He had the true spirit of his office; his preaching
awful and affecting, and his life very holy. Being
much followed from places around, the clergy greatly
disliked him&mdash;used to reflect upon him at their visitations&mdash;looked
upon him with an evil eye; so that at
length, finding his situation very uncomfortable, he
quitted his living, became pastor of a Dissenting congregation
at Oundle, and came from thence to Kettering,
where he died."</p>

<p>The next pastor of the Church was Mr. William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Terry, supposed to have come from Hitchin to Kettering.
He remained but a short time here, and then
removed to London. During his ministry 36 persons
were added to the Church. From the recollections
of an aged intelligent woman it is stated, that Mr.
Terry was popular as a preacher&mdash;that he had travelled
in Holland and Germany, and did not seem inclined to
settle long in any place.</p>

<p>In the year 1709 Mr. John Wills became pastor of
the Church. It is stated concerning him, "that he
was a gentlemanlike man, of popular talents." During
the first three or four years of his ministry 27 members
were added to the Church; but his conduct at length
gave a great blow to the cause with which he had become
connected. He acted in a manner so contrary to
the Christian character, and so injured himself as a
Christian minister, as to be discarded by the Church.
Between the dates of August, 1712, and July, 1715,
he was charged with notorious lying, and other scandalous
sins, for which he was repeatedly admonished
by the Church; but not giving satisfaction by his
spirit and conduct, he was dismissed.</p>

<p>After this he remained in Kettering about four
years; set up a separate interest; drew up a Church
covenant, July 15th, 1715, in which mention is made
of 46 members, most of whom had belonged to the
other Church, having been drawn away by him,
though most of them returned during the ministry of
his successor. His bad conduct caused him to be soon
rejected by the party that went off with him.</p>

<p>There was another part of his conduct towards his
former charge which appears to have been very dishonourable.
The people had raised a subscription, and
purchased a dwelling-house for their minister, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
a considerable garden. Mr. Wills occupied it as the
minister, but wished to make some addition to it, and
to secure himself prevailed on the people to have the
house surrendered to him, which, from the regard they
then had for him, they unwisely permitted to be
done. Consequently, after the Church had dismissed
him from his office, he still retained the house, and
at length sold it, keeping the whole amount of the
money, pleading as his excuse that it was but as
much as he had laid out upon it, with other disadvantages
that he had in removing. He went to
Wellingham, Cambridgeshire.</p>

<p>Such things as these would present some serious
hindrances to the advancement of religion among the
people, while a man of this character sustained the
office of pastor, and afterwards sought to draw away
disciples after him.</p>

<p>On the 11th of November, 1714, Mr. Thomas Milway,
jun., the son of the former pastor of this name,
was settled over them. At the time when his settlement
took place, 112 persons are registered as belonging
to the Church. During his ministry, which continued
only for six years and a half, 48 members were
admitted. He removed to Ipswich in March, 1721.</p>

<p>In reference to the removal of Mr. Milway from
Kettering to Ipswich, we have received the following
extracts from the Church records of the latter place:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>At a Church-meeting, the 26th of October, 1720, the Church
gave a call to Mr. Thomas Milway, at Kettering, to the pastoral
office, in the following words, and signed as underwritten
by the brethren of the Church:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
"<i>To the Rev. Mr. Thomas Milway, at Kettering.</i></div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The sovereign Lord of life and death having
called to rest from his labours and affliction here our late dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
pastor, the Rev. and worthy Mr. Benjamin Glandfield, the
Congregational Church of Christ at Ipswich are thereby left
as sheep without a shepherd. We, the members of the said
Church, have humbled ourselves before the Lord by fasting
and prayer, imploring his direction under this solemn dispensation,
and do think our present duty is, the endeavouring to
fill up that relation by calling one duly qualified for the pastoral
office; and having several times had experience of the
excellent gifts and graces God in his mercy hath bestowed
on you, we cannot but acknowledge how generally acceptable
they are to this Church and auditory; and having had several
informations of your present circumstances at Kettering, and
the way plain and easy for a removal; and considering that
your settlement with us in the pastoral office is likely to be of
great service to the interest of Christ in these parts, and for
the uniting and settling of this Church, which otherwise is
like to fall into great confusions&mdash;therefore, we, the brethren
of the Church aforesaid, at a meeting this 26th of October,
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '1820'">1720</ins>, do hereby call and desire you to take the pastoral office
in this Church, praying the Lord, the great Shepherd of the
sheep, to direct, incline, and settle you with us, unto whose
divine providence we commit this great affair, trusting the
Lord will enable us to perform those duties required of us.
We desire you at a convenient time as possible to return
answer to our desires and call, which will greatly oblige, dear
Sir, your most affectionate friends and servants in one Lord,</p>

<div class="signature2">(Signed) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   "Thos. Wyneall, }&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div class="signature2">"Joseph Wyatt,  }  Deacons.</div>

<div class="center">"With many others, brethren of the Church."</div>
</blockquote>

<p>In another page, in Mr. Milway's own handwriting,
there are the names of the 41 brethren and the 79
sisters who joined in the call of Thomas Milway to
the pastoral office. "All these distinctly," he observes,
"and one by one, gave their consent to my taking the
pastoral office. The 10th of August, 1721, was a day
set apart for solemn prayer to implore a blessing upon
my pastoral labours," when he records the names of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
ministers who engaged and were present, and adds,
"We have good grounds to hope the Lord was with
us, and did assist in the work; and that a spirit of
supplication was poured out upon us. For which, his
abundant mercy, may we bless him for ever; and
may a gracious God say to pastor and people, 'From
this day will I bless you.' Amen and amen."</p>

<p>Short was the course of his ministry here; for we
are further informed, that "the Rev. Thomas Milway
died the Lord's-day, May 31st, 1724, in the morning,
aged 47. He lies buried in the aisle, immediately in
front of the pulpit, as does his wife, Mrs. Mary Milway,
who died September 9th, 1751, aged 75. He appears
to have been honoured and useful during his short
ministry at Ipswich.</p>

<p>During this period, about the year 1715, the Meeting
House at Kettering was threatened, and thought to
be in danger of being pulled down by a lawless mob.
The reaction that had taken place in favour of the Dissenters
when they aided in effecting the glorious Revolution
by William the Third, had now passed by. During
the reign of Anne, the enemies of Dissent exerted themselves
to abridge their liberties. The trial of Sacheveral,
a high Church bigot, under the Whig ministry,
and the triumph he obtained among the people, produced
a great excitement. Mob violence was employed
against the Dissenters, and many Meeting Houses were
pulled down. The death of Anne, in 1714, was succeeded
by the peaceful accession of the first monarch
of the House of Hanover, who at once declared that
"he was determined to adhere to the principles of
toleration, and endeavour to unite all his Protestant
subjects by affording them all equal protection."</p>

<p>But there were numbers who considered it hard not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
to be allowed to persecute by law, and who therefore
determined to avenge themselves and their defeated
party by setting the law at defiance, in order to enjoy
the luxury of worrying Dissenters. Hence in many
towns in England, during this year, Dissenters were
insulted, and their places of worship pulled down or
burned. But the Meeting House at Kettering, though
threatened, was preserved. "The mob supposed that
the building was well guarded within by people armed
for the purpose, which prevented them from making
the attempt. It is not known what defence was made,
but no mischief was done."</p>

<p>At the time when Mr. Milway, junior, removed from
Kettering, a small congregation of Dissenters in the
noted town of Coventry had a Mr. Thomas Saunders
preaching to them. He was a descendant from Lawrence
Saunders, the martyr, who was burnt at Coventry
in Queen Mary's days, 1555. The family had possessed
a large estate at or near Bedworth, but lost the greater
part of it on account of religion. A Mr. Julian Saunders,
uncle of this Mr. Thomas Saunders, was a Nonconformist
minister at Bedworth; and under him the
nephew was educated for the ministry.</p>

<p>On Lord's-day, May 21st, 1721, Mr. Saunders
preached, we suppose for the first time, at Kettering.
Such was the favourable impression produced by his
services on that day, that he was thought by the congregation
to be a proper person to become their pastor;
and they immediately began to take steps towards
bringing him into this relation to them. It was treated
by both parties, the Church and the minister, as a
matter of high importance. The society to which Mr.
Saunders ministered at Coventry was very unwilling
to part with him. The Church at Kettering was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
equally anxious to obtain his services; and then he
states, as one great reason that influenced his decision,
"he should have ten times the number of people to
preach to that he had at Coventry." After a suitable
time for further trial, for consultation, and prayer for
divine direction, he at length accepted the invitation of
the Church at Kettering, and entered on his stated
engagements there September 14th, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '1821'">1721</ins>. He was
set apart to the pastoral office by solemn services on
November 23rd of the same year. The following is
the account Mr. Saunders gives of the services of the
day:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Thursday, November 23rd, 1721, was appointed a day of
fasting and prayer upon the account of our sitting down
together. Mr. Cartwright, of Buckby, begun with prayer,
and prayed well. Mr. Some read over the call of the Church,
and asked my acceptance, and then prayed, and indeed prayed
in prayer. Mr. Tingey, of Northampton, preached from
2 Chron. xv. 2. Mr. Jennings concluded with prayer, and
Mr. Norris prayed among us in the evening. And now to
thee, O God! must I give an account for this, and all my
actions. I have been persuaded in my own mind, and am still,
that I ought to labour where I can do most for God, and that
thou, Lord, wilt take it well at the hands of thy servants that
study so to do. Let us be made blessings to each other.
Let us find thy presence and grace with us. Let much be
done for God amongst us, that may effectually answer the
clamour of malicious persons, and "put to silence the ignorance
of foolish men," as well as be made confirming to thy
people here. Propter Jesum Christum salvalorem nostrum,
cui nunc et in secula seculorum gloria. Amen.</p></blockquote>

<p>"In his younger days," observes Mr. Some, in giving
some account of Mr. Saunders, "he was much
addicted to those amusements and diversions in which
too many in the present day lavish away their precious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
time, while their best and most valuable interests are
neglected. But "it pleased God," who designed him
for eminent service, "to call him by his grace, and to
reveal his Son in him," which effectually reclaimed
him from the follies of youth, and led him afterwards
frequently to drop a tear over them, praying that they
might be remembered no more. As soon as he had
received the grace of God, it was his great concern to
watch against everything that might obstruct his progress
in religion, and to use all proper means to promote
and strengthen the Christian temper in all its
branches. It was a strong desire to do good to the
souls of men, by "teaching transgressors the ways of
God, that sinners might be converted to him," which
inclined him to devote himself to the work of the
ministry. He found so much real satisfaction in religion,
that he was willing others might taste its pleasures;
and he saw so much danger in a course of sin,
that he thought he could not do a kinder office than to
warn men of it, that they might escape the pollution
and condemnation to which it would expose them.
He was not so early in his preparation for this holy
employment as some others; but with the blessing
of God on his great industry and indefatigable endeavours,
he soon came forth qualified with such endowments
which are of the greatest importance to render
ministers useful to the Church of Christ. He became
eminently qualified for the ministry of the Gospel,
and his labours were greatly blest to his people, by
whom he was held in the highest esteem.</p>

<p>The congregation so increased soon after Mr. Saunders
came to Kettering, that it was found necessary to
build a larger place of worship, which the congregation
did in the year 1723. This building stands to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
day, though it has undergone considerable alterations.
It is 50&frac12; ft. by 45&frac12; within the walls, with three galleries.
It is calculated to seat more than 800 hearers.
At its erection some gentleman in or near London gave
a handsome chandelier, with 24 sockets.</p>

<p>During the ministry of Mr. Saunders, Mr. William
Hextal, son of Mr. Hextal, a farmer at Broughton, a
village about three miles from Kettering, became a
member of the Church, and studied under Mr. Saunders
for a time, preparatory to his entering Doddridge's
academy, with a view to the ministry. It is recorded
in the Church-book&mdash;"At a Church-meeting held
June 2nd, 1731, Mr. William Hextal was received
into our communion; and as he is now engaged in learning
for the work of the ministry, I gave him a solemn
charge in relation to these things; and added several
things that I apprehended he should practise as a
Christian, in order to his being a minister." At the
close of his academic course, Mr. Hextal was settled at
Creaton, afterwards removed to Sudbury, and from
thence to Northampton.</p>

<p>Mr. Saunders published a funeral sermon preached
at Woodford, near Kettering, from Rev. xiii. 14, entitled
'The Blessedness of Pious Persons after Death
considered.' Also, a letter was printed, which he
wrote in his last illness to his people; which was, by
his direction, publicly read to them after his funeral
sermon. "Well worth the attention," it is said, "of all
destitute Churches." He died in the midst of his life
and usefulness, after an illness of some months, July
21st, 1736. In the records of the Church it is stated
that "he was an evangelical preacher, had a very
happy delivery, an agreeable temper, and graceful
appearance; was much respected by the Church people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and much endeared to his own flock, who lamented
their loss many years after." His funeral sermon was
preached by Mr. Some, of Harborough, from a passage
Mr. Saunders had chosen, 1 Cor. xv. 10&mdash;"Not I, but
the grace of God that was with me." We shall quote
some passages from this discourse, relating to the character
and qualifications of Mr. Saunders:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>He had a great gift in prayer, and could express himself very
copiously and pertinently in that sacred exercise, especially
on particular occasions. His preaching was plain, scriptural,
and experimental, in the good old puritanical strain. He did
not affect "the enticing words of man's wisdom," which
please the fancy; neither was he nicely curious in the form
of his discourses; but it was his endeavour to touch the conscience
and impress the heart. He insisted largely on the
peculiar doctrines of the Gospel, especially on the atonement
of Christ and the sanctifying influences of the Spirit. He
looked upon these as the two pillars in the New Testament
temple, without which the whole building would soon fall to
the ground. These were his favourite subjects, his delightful
topics, which triumphed in his sermons, and diffused themselves
through all his performances. He never failed to introduce
them whenever the argument in hand led to them; and sometimes,
like holy Paul, with whose writings he was so much
delighted and edified, he did not scruple a digression which
might exalt the name and grace of a Redeemer, and endear
him to himself and his hearers. He was fully persuaded that
these were the essential parts of the Gospel scheme; that
they were clearly revealed in the holy Scriptures; that they
could not be dropt without giving up Christianity: and
what he had felt of the importance of them to himself was
one great reason of his inviolable attachment to them.</p>

<p>He was diligent in his work, and in labours more abundant.
Besides the care of his own congregation, which was very large,
he frequently visited his friends abroad; preached several
lectures; and was ready to lay hold on every opportunity to do
good: and God wonderfully owned and blessed his labours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
There were many added to the Church under his immediate
care, and a promising harvest appeared to be springing up
there, even when God laid him aside and called him to receive
his reward. May it grow up to maturity, to the joy of such
as may enter on his labours. But his usefulness was not confined
to his own people: there are several in other places,
both in the great city and in the country, which have reason
to bless God for the benefit which they received by his
ministry. His course was short, but it was well run. He had
not quite twenty years allowed for public service in the Church
of Christ; but there are few in these later times that have
done so much in so short a time.</p>

<p>He was a person of great moderation, and behaved with
much decency and candour towards those who differed from
him. He claimed a liberty of judging for himself in matters
of religion, and as readily granted the same to others; which
did not proceed from a coldness and indifference towards that
which appeared to him to be "the faith once delivered to the
saints," but from an earnest desire to secure and propagate it.
It was his fixed and settled judgment that the mind of man
could not be forced; that things must be received in the light
in which they appear to the understanding; that heat and
passion eclipse the glory of Gospel truths; and that severe
censures, given out by fallible and uninspired men, would prejudice
persons against them.</p>

<p>To his own people he was a tender and affectionate shepherd,
sympathizing with them in their trials, counselling
them in their difficulties, relieving and supporting them in
their straits, and praying earnestly for them in all their
troubles. So cordially was he united in affection to them,
that no solicitations could prevail upon him to remove from
them, though considerable offers were made him from abroad,
and great importunity used to prevail on him to accept them.
This endeared him very much to his flock, and did not a little
contribute to the success of his labours among them.</p>

<p>He met with many uncommon afflictions, under which he
generally appeared easy and cheerful. He did not burden his
friends with long and tedious complaints, but poured them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
out before that God who is able to "help in every time of
need"; and he was supported and carried comfortably through
several of them. They certainly gave him uneasiness, and
might impair his health; but they contributed very much to
the improvement of his better part: he came forth out of the
furnace as "gold tried in the fire"; and some of the best
sermons he ever preached were those which succeeded his
severest exercises. These led his thoughts very far into the
mysteries of providence, and enabled him to set many of its
darkest scenes in a fair light, that he might comfort those
that were in any trouble by the comfort wherewith he had
been comforted of God.</p></blockquote>

<p>The sentiments and counsels of dying Christians,
especially of ministers who have been devoted to
their work, have some peculiar solemnity and weight.
On this account we shall give a few passages from a
letter, written by Mr. Saunders to his flock during
his last illness, which was by his direction publicly
read to his people immediately after his funeral
sermon.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Dearly beloved in the Lord</span>,&mdash;You well know that for a
great while I have laboured under the afflicting hand of God,
during a considerable part of which time I could not tell but I
might be again permitted to speak to you in his name; but
when at length all reasonable hopes of this kind were cut off,
I began to think of writing a few lines to leave with you. My
weakness increasing put me off those thoughts, until the importunity
of a friend animated my former resolution and set
me upon it.</p>

<p>Providence favoured me with a station of service among
you for upwards of fourteen years, during which season I was
led through a great variety of trying afflictions; under which,
as God was pleased to direct and support me in a very surprising
way, and at last delivered me, so I must in justice say
that you behaved to me in the most affectionate and Christian
manner. You were sharers with me in my afflictions; your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
mouths, upon every emergency, were readily opened unto God
for me; you rejoiced with me in the removal of my affliction
and every favourable turn given to my affairs; and you bore the
many interruptions of my service with unparalleled patience
and cheerfulness. This could not fail of begetting in me the
greatest endearedness and tenderest affection for you; so that
my soul was knit to you. My great concern was to serve you;
I never thought myself so happy as when I was labouring
among you; and often begged that, if it were consistent with
the will of God, I might live and die amongst you. And I
can now look back with pleasure, to think that I was enabled
to refuse all the solicitations I had to leave you. God
has been seen amongst us; there has been a glory upon our
assemblies; and the great ends of a Gospel ministry, such as
the conversion of some, and the training up of others for a
better world, I hope have been in some measure attained
amongst us. But now I speak no more, nor you hear me any
more. And yet, though I am gone from you, I persuade myself,
from the cheerful attention you paid to my services while
among you, that you will at least lend an ear to what in this
manner I say to you. In this respect you may truly apply
that passage&mdash;"Being dead, he yet speaketh."</p></blockquote>

<p>In a further paragraph he states&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>I have no other foundation for my own soul than what I
have represented unto you as the only foundation for you to
build upon, and that you know is God's everlasting love, displayed
and drawn out in the sending of his Son, and all that
he has done, is doing, and will do for us; and in the complete
work of the Spirit in forming us for, and bringing us unto,
the full possession and enjoyment of all at last. And what a
glorious work, my friends, is this! You have it in miniature
when the soul is born again: there is then every essential
part; but there must be a great many perfecting strokes before
the piece will be complete, and fit to be set in the presence
chamber above. There are some sour and knotty pieces,
that require more hewing and polishing than others. In
some, the constitutional evil may perhaps not be removed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
until the constitution itself be broken; which may in some
measure account for the difference of the dispensations that
good men pass through in this world.</p></blockquote>

<p>After other weighty remarks, he gives them advice
as to the choice of a successor:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>(1.) Don't forsake the assembling of yourselves together, to
cry unto the Lord of the harvest to send a labourer amongst
you: a loiterer will do you no good. Keep up, and all of you
frequent, prayer-meetings. "If you seek him, he will be found
of you." Whilst God is with and amongst you, all will be
well. I have never yet seen, but where Churches have waited
upon God, and kept up their application to him, they have
succeeded well at last, though sometimes it has been long
first. "He has never said to the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me, in
vain."</p>

<p>(2.) Let your first views of the person you fix upon be, at
what he himself is: I mean, endeavour above all things to
have a man of religion, who shall be able to talk over the
great things of God in a feeling, experimental manner. If
this be not the case, whatever his gifts may be, and how
popular soever his talents, vital religion will dwindle under
his ministrations; or, if you should maintain the name, the
thing will be lost. Neither the orthodoxy of his judgment
nor the popularity of his delivery will ever compensate the
want of this. Nor can you expect a blessing from heaven,
and that success should attend the service of that man that
is not inward with God, and hearty for him in what he does.
"The tree is known by his fruits."</p>

<p>(3.) When you have satisfied yourselves in the best manner
you can as to the religious part, then have regard to prudence
and temper. If a man have not prudence, what will he do
that must necessarily be concerned with so many different
dispositions&mdash;families under a great variety of circumstances,
as well as those who are round about them? And if he is not
a man of temper, you will have the less pleasure and advantage
from his conversation. Some will neglect him; others
will be afraid to communicate their sentiments unto him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
How many, otherwise famous men, who seemed to be formed
for considerable service, have miscarried here!</p>

<p>(4.) Remember, you are in a state of imperfection yourselves;
and such, after all your care, will be the person you
have to labour among you: a man subject to like passions
and infirmities with yourselves&mdash;one who at times may need
your pity and forbearance, as you share in his. However,
though this be a reason against being too curious and tedious,
yet, on the other hand, do not be too hasty in your determination.
"In the multitude of counsellors there is safety."
You are to make the choice and determine the affair; but, in
order to your doing this with steadiness and prudence, advise
with some grave, solid persons, that you know are concerned
for your welfare, and will give you the best direction they can.</p>

<p>(5.) I beseech and entreat you, that you "fall not out by
the way, seeing you are brethren." Be together as the primitive
Church was, with one accord as well as in one place.
Oh, that of you it might be said, as of them, that "the multitudes
that believed were of one heart and of one soul." Bury
for ever&mdash;bury all former prejudices. How would my soul
have rejoiced to have seen that happy day! But I please
myself to think it will soon be, and therefore shall use the
Apostle's words (Phil. ii. 1, 2), "if there be any consolation
in Christ."</p>

<p>I had a design of saying something more; but He that has
cut me short in all the other parts of my work, has done so
in this last attempt of respect and labour of love: but they
are the words of a dying man, and the real sentiments of
my heart. I shall leave that passage with you (Acts xx. 32),
"And now, brethren, I commend you to God and to the word
of his grace," &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the year 1727, Mr. Saunders being in London,
Doddridge supplied the pulpit at Kettering for a Sabbath,
when he was minister of Kibworth. A letter
Mr. Saunders wrote to Doddridge immediately after
this will just serve to show that while Mr. Saunders
was blessed with much comfort and usefulness, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
not every one of the members of his Church that had
imbibed the spirit of their pastor.</p>


<div class="center"><i>To Mr. Doddridge.</i></div>

<blockquote>
<div class="signature"><i>June 1st, 1727.</i></div>


<p><span class="smcap">My very dear and valuable Friend</span>,&mdash;I am extremely
obliged to you for your kind and consolatory epistle, and also
for your kind services last Lord's-day; but am very sorry that
my clerk should abscond. I suppose it was to give a specimen
of his high orthodoxy, and for fear his tender conscience
should be defiled with some of good old Mr. Baxter's divinity.
Now this man, who is so much afraid for himself, has lately
put a son apprentice in London, where he frequently hears
swearing in the family, and is obliged to go to church, and
has not liberty so much as to come and hear me now I am in
town. But I always observed that the most highly orthodox,
are remarkably defective in some branch or other of the
Christian character. This is the man, too, who was so much
offended because Mr. Brock was not excommunicated for
going to church, who has now obliged his own child to attend
it for seven years! I hope my very good friend Doddridge will
take no notice of his conduct, nor in the least slight his
friends at Kettering upon that account. There are not many
such as he, though I cannot say but there is more than one;
but were they generally of his mind, I would preach the
Gospel to the wild Indians before I would serve them. You
have a great many sincere friends in Kettering that love you
well, and are always pleased with your good services; and I
may without compliment say, when I am there, that you have
one who esteems you according to your desert, and that, in my
opinion, is beyond any man of your standing I ever knew.</p></blockquote>

<p>After the death of Mr. Saunders the Church wished
to have Mr. Wood, afterwards Dr. Wood, of Norwich,
to be their pastor, but he declined acceding to their
request. Mr. Benjamin Boyce, then a student at
Northampton, under Dr. Doddridge, was invited on
probation; and on May 7, 1740, he was ordained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Of the ordination service Mr. Boyce gives the following
account:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Mr. Julius Saunders, of Denton, introduced the solemnity
with a very serious and suitable prayer; after which Mr.
Floyd more fully engaged in prayer, with great copiousness
of expression, and I hope with great fervency. Mr. Simson
preached a very plain and evangelical sermon from 2 Cor.
iv. 7&mdash;"We have this treasure in earthen vessels," &amp;c. Mr.
Goodrich read the invitation of the Church, to which the
deacons present expressed their consent in the name of the
Church by lifting up their hands, with which I declared my
determination to comply. The same person received my confession
of faith, which I publicly read; and after asking me
several questions usual upon such an occasion, prayed over
me. Dr. Doddridge gave me a very affectionate and important
charge, which I desire never to forget; and to the people, a
very free and affectionate exhortation. The whole solemnity
was concluded by Mr. Dorsley in prayer.</p>

<p>Oh that God would make his strength perfect in my weakness,
and his grace in my unworthiness! Oh that a double
portion of his blessed Spirit may be poured upon me, who am
so weak an instrument! and that such grace may be given
me, who am less than the least of all saints, that I may
"preach the unsearchable riches of Christ," and may be
owned of him in my sincere desires and mean endeavours, if
it is agreeable to the purpose of his grace, to fit and prepare
many souls, that are either brought home or are yet strangers
to him, by faith and holiness, for the complete enjoyment of
"the inheritance of the saints in light." Thus may the
Church of God be daily increased and edified, till all its
pastors and all its members shall meet together to ascribe
glory and grace to Him that sits on the throne and the Lamb
for ever. Amen.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Boyce continued his ministry for 30 years
over this people. During that period 161 members
were added to the Church, and at his death the
Church numbered 120 members. He died October<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
24th, 1770, aged 54 years. "Mr. Boyce was a native
of Coventry, educated for the ministry at Northampton;
in size rather under the middle stature. He was
a close student, a practical and experimental preacher."</p>

<p>The Meeting House was new roofed soon after the
commencement of his ministry, which indicates that it
could not have been done well at the first, as it had
only been built about 18 years. Several new pews
were made over the stairs leading to the galleries, and
where forms had before been set; which pews were
immediately filled, and continued so, as did all the
others, until his death. He was buried in the aisle
before the pulpit, where his wife also, and mother, and
two children were interred; and a handsome stone, with
a suitable inscription, was placed in the front of the
desk. "He lived much beloved, and died much lamented."
Robert Hall observes, "that Mr. Boyce
sustained the pastoral office for a long series of years
with the highest reputation and success; and his death
was deplored as an irreparable calamity, leaving it
very improbable that a successor could be speedily
found capable of uniting the suffrages of a people
whose confidence and esteem he had so long exclusively
enjoyed. Such is the imperfection of the
present state, that the possession of a more than ordinary
portion of felicity is the usual forerunner of a
correspondent degree of privation and distress; and the
removal of a pastor who has long been the object of
veneration generally places a Church in a critical situation,
exposed to feuds and dissensions arising out of
the necessity of a new choice." This appeared in the
case of Mr. Boyce's immediate successor.</p>

<p>Mr. Addington, of Harborough, delivered the funeral
oration at the interment of Mr. Boyce, and Mr. Gregson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of Rowell, preached the funeral sermon, from 1 Thess.
iv. 13, 14. In the closing part of that sermon we find
the following statements in the account given of Mr.
Boyce:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>It should be known that he feared the Lord, like good
Obadiah, greatly, from his youth. He gave himself up to the
Church of Christ under the pastoral care of Mr. Simpson, of
Coventry, when he was 16 years of age. He acquired a rich
stock of useful and valuable knowledge from those who were
admirably capable of imparting from their rich treasures.
Thus furnished, he began the sacred work of the ministry
before he was 21 years of age, and has told you, in the last
letter he will ever write, "It was the determination with
which I preached my first sermon among you, to know nothing
comparatively, but Jesus Christ, and him crucified; and I
trust it has been my sincere concern to continue in that resolution
to the last, testifying repentance towards God, and
faith in the Lord Jesus Christ." You are his witnesses, my
dear brethren, how well, through divine grace, he abode by
his determination, and you well know that the doctrines of the
rich, free, and sovereign grace of God were his delight to
study and to preach; and you must know how wisely and
judiciously he stated them&mdash;with what caution, guarding
against every extreme, and every abuse of those great and
glorious truths. You cannot but know with what discreet
zeal, with what plainness and fidelity, he published the grace
of God in the ever-blessed and glorious Redeemer. Was not
this the chief topic he delighted to insist upon? and particularly
to show what holy, divine, and heavenly influence it
ought to have upon the hearts and lives of men? and did he
not do this in a very persuasive and pathetic manner? Did
he not preach Christ Jesus the Lord, and constantly in his
ministrations lay no other foundation than Christ Jesus,
which God has laid in Zion, for your faith and hope to build
and rest your eternal concerns upon? How has he declared in
that very serious and affectionate epistle he sent you, "I
know no other foundation that God has laid in Zion; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
more I survey the excellence of it, as given us in the Scriptures,
the more I can say it is tried and precious. Nothing
else will do to support the stress of our eternal hope, or indeed
the pressure of painful afflictions. Blessed be God, here is
support! here is consolation! it rejoices me to think that
there are so many that can add the testimony of their experience
to mine." The great God had blessed him with a happy
temper and amiable carriage and behaviour. He knew how
to weep with those that weep, and to rejoice with those that
rejoice. He abhorred the mean conduct of too many in this
degenerate world, the speaking evil of others; and was he not
an example to believers in word, in conversation, in charity,
in spirit, in faith, in purity, and in prudence, for almost
thirty-three years (which was almost double the number of
the years of his predecessor), amongst you, the people of his
charge? Oh how comfortable and delightful was the frame of
his mind in this his last illness, which suddenly came on him,
made rapid progress in extinguishing such a useful and precious
light in this our Israel! On the last Saturday se'nnight,
being the 20th of October, when he lay down upon his dying
bed, he found great comfort from those words, in Romans
viii., former part of the 34th verse: "Who is he that condemneth?
it is Christ that died." He spake these words
with tears of joy. His language was, "Whom have I in
heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth I desire beside
thee." When he was asked how he did by one of his friends,
he answered, "I am well, for the consolations of God are
neither few nor small; God has not left me, nor will he leave
me." When I asked him how it was with him with respect
to a better world, his answer was, with great pleasure in his
countenance, "I can cheerfully trust my good God." He
seemed always, during the intervals of his wanderings, to be
praying, and before he died was very sensible; and, as far as
can be learned, he spent his last breath in committing you,
his dear people, to God in prayer (in which he had an excellent
gift), and then sweetly fell asleep in Jesus, after
having finished his appointed work and service.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Boyce died little more than six months after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the death of her husband, and that shortly after giving
birth to an infant. From her funeral sermon, preserved
in manuscript among the records of the Church,
we present the following extract:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>After having summoned the tender and happy husband
from the amiable partner of his joys and cares, and left her in
widowhood to mourn his absence for awhile, he calls her to
follow him&mdash;takes her away from all her new-formed and
pleasing connexions, and (affecting consideration!) takes her
likewise from her new-born babe. Methinks I could now
take the dear little forsaken stranger, and present it to you in
my arms (in the arms of my affection I do)&mdash;hear it saying, in
accents truly tender and striking, "Pity me, pity me, O my
friends, all ye my late worthy father's friends, my dear mother's
friends, for the hand of the Lord hath bereaved me; those
who might have been the guides of my youth he has taken
away." Say you not?&mdash;yes, I think I read the language in
some of your countenances, and in your tears&mdash;"Though
father and though mother, dear babe, have forsaken thee, the
Lord take thee up."</p></blockquote>

<p>Referring to the death of Mr. Boyce, the preacher
observes&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Though, as a congregation, he has taken away from you an
able, faithful, useful shepherd, who watched for your souls as
one that must give an account&mdash;even under a trial and loss
great as that is, it becomes you not to censure or complain.
Our good friend who is now taken away manifested the happy
influence of the Gospel hope in the composure of her spirit
under that great loss which she lately sustained, and through
the afflictions by which she was removed, thankfully embracing
and sweetly relying upon the Redeemer's consolation to
his disciples in John xiv. 2-4, "In my Father's house are
many mansions," &amp;c. Referring to him who has recently
been taken away from her and from you, she said, with apparent
pleasure, in her last illness, "I shall soon be with the
good man in glory"; speaking in joyful terms of being taken
to sing praises with the saints in glory, for ever and ever.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>In the month of April, 1771, an invitation was
given to Mr. John Fuller to remain amongst them
twelve months on trial, with a view to his becoming
the pastor. At the expiration of that time a unanimous
invitation was given to him. Mr. Fuller was
ordained August 6th, 1772, when we find Messrs.
Denny, Wright, King, Gregson, Dr. Ashworth, Addington,
Hextal, and Dowley, were engaged. Mr.
Fuller had been a member of the Church in Gravel
Lane, London, under the pastoral care of the Rev.
Noah Hill.</p>

<p>But in little more than two years from this time,
dissatisfaction arose in the Church with the ministry
of Mr. Fuller. It is stated, that "several persons
proposed an assistant to Mr. Fuller, but the proposal
was rejected by Mr. Fuller and his friends." The
assistant proposed was a Mr. Richard Fuller, cousin
to the pastor.</p>

<p>Under date of August 14th, 1774, we are informed
"that a dissatisfaction having arisen in the minds of
some of the Church members and subscribers with
Mr. Fuller's preaching, and there being no prospect
of peace and happiness, he this day declared his resigning
his charge as minister and pastor; but supplied
the congregation by others until Michaelmas, always
behaving with a good temper and spirit, although his
ministry was not by several approved." In our early
days we have heard from some of the older members
of the Church that the text of Mr. Fuller's farewell
sermon was (Gen. xlv. 24) Joseph's counsel to his
brethren, "See that ye fall not out by the way."</p>

<p>But after the removal of Mr. Fuller, great discord
and confusion prevailed in the Church and congregation.
The friends of the late pastor, who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
attached to his person and ministry, were greatly displeased
with the conduct of those who had been the
means of his removal. Many things were done and
said which were very painful to both parties, created
much ill feeling amongst themselves, and exposed them
to the derision of the men of the world.</p>

<p>After some time they sent an invitation to Mr.
Saunders, of Bedworth, who they understood was desirous
to remove; but the invitation not being unanimous,
it was declined.</p>

<p>Their attention was soon after directed to the Rev.
T. N. Toller, who was a student in the academy at
Daventry. Mr. Toller first preached to them as a
supply, October 1st, 1775, when he was not quite
twenty years of age. The first text was Acts xiii.
26: "Unto you is the word of this salvation sent."
In the following April, two of the deacons went to
Daventry to invite Mr. Toller to become their stated
supply for three months; at the expiration of this time,
he was again invited for nine months; after which he
received an invitation to become their pastor, which
invitation was cheerfully signed, June 15th, 1777, by
87 persons, as the call of the Church to the pastoral
office. The ordination service was held May 28th,
1778, when Messrs. Gregson, of Rowell, Palmer, of
Hackney, Addington, of Harborough, Robins, of Daventry
(Mr. Toller's tutor), Toller, of London (uncle to
the pastor), and Bull, of Newport, engaged in the services
of the day.</p>

<p>Thus commenced the longest pastorate with which
the Church had yet been favoured; for Mr. Toller
continued to labour amongst them until February 26th,
1821, making forty-five years and five months from
the time of his first preaching at Kettering until his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
death. It was a ministry of much acceptance, extended
influence, and great usefulness. It restored
peace to a divided people; it preserved them in unbroken
harmony through all its course; the congregation
having often a crowded appearance, and the
Church being generally in a prosperous state; not so
much perhaps by the numbers added to the Church,
as by the advancing piety, devotion, consistency, and
intelligence of its members.</p>

<p>There were 221 members added to the Church
during the course of Mr. Toller's ministry. These
members, we have no doubt, might have been greatly
increased, had the methods adopted in some places for
bringing forward candidates for the communion of the
Church prevailed under the ministry of Mr. Toller.
We should like to convey some idea to the mind of
the reader of the nature of that ministry with which
the congregation at Kettering were now favoured. It
was in his stated services amongst his own people
that the peculiar excellencies of Mr. Toller were developed.
It was our privilege in early life to sit
under that ministry, but we think we shall fail to
present a correct view of the impression we have on
our mind as to the distinguishing features, the peculiar
beauties, of that ministry; and if we were to do this,
the general reader would think it too highly coloured,
as our first impressions of sacred things, our deepest
and most lively emotions of a religious nature, in
connexion with all that we may since have known
or attained, appear to us to have been derived, under
God, from the ministry of Mr. Toller. His person
was above the middle stature; his appearance in the
pulpit venerable and commanding; his voice deep and
powerful; his manner all his own, and of such a character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
as to chain the attention of the audience&mdash;always
earnest, sometimes most fervent and impressive,
rising to a high degree of impassioned eloquence
when his assemblies were crowded, as on the afternoon
of the Sabbath. His language was always clear,
forcible, and plain, suited to the manner of his preaching;
his sentiments most decidedly scriptural, evangelical,
and practical, with a considerable portion of
experimental piety. His ministry presented a full
exhibition of the Christian temper. His discourses
were distinguished by great conciseness yet fulness
of matter, presenting often the most familiar but
beautiful illustrations. Some of his most impressive
sermons were formed entirely on the applicatory
plan&mdash;some of them founded on Scripture inquiries,
such as, "What think ye of Christ?" "Dost thou
believe on the Son of God?" &amp;c. During a very large
portion of his ministry he delivered expository discourses
on the morning of the Sabbath, which were
distinguished by great beauty, variety, and richness of
improving remarks. The afternoon sermon generally
rose out of the morning exposition; not so frequently
from a text taken from the paragraph expounded as a
passage suggested by the main subject of exposition.
But the prayers he offered in the stated services of
the sanctuary were perhaps the most remarkable of
the whole&mdash;the manner was so solemn; the tone so
devotional; the adorations so sublime; the confessions
so abasing; the petitions so full, fervent, and appropriate;
the thanksgiving so expressive and exalted;
the surrender so complete and unreserved; the whole
placing us so much in the presence of God, leading us
to feel what we were before him, what we needed from
him, what provision was made for us, what we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
receiving, and what services we should render; often
leading us on to the dying hour, and to the opening
grandeurs of eternity. The value of such a ministry
was apparent in the many cases of eminent piety that
appeared amongst those that were trained up under it.
Much of the Christian temper, the spirit of devotion,
lively faith in the Redeemer, and the power of practical
religion, were manifested in a considerable number
of cases, considering the size of the place. There
were "living epistles of Christ, known and read of
all." We remember an eminently pious female member
of the Church, of whom the pastor said, when improving
her death, "He should esteem it an honour
to be permitted to hold up her train in the heavenly
world." While this showed the deep humility of the
pastor, it showed the high estimate he had formed of
the devoted member.</p>

<p>In the year 1799 Mr. Toller received invitations
from the congregations at Carter Lane, London, and
at Clapham, to become their minister, with an offer
of great pecuniary advantages; but such was the attachment
felt to him by his people at Kettering, as
manifested in their great anxiety on the subject, and
in the affectionate addresses presented to him on this
occasion, that he gave a decided negative to these
urgent and repeated solicitations.</p>

<p>In an address he delivered from the pulpit, in
answer to those which he had received from his people,
he bore a noble testimony to the kindness with
which he had ever been treated by them; observing,
"Twenty-four years ago I came to this place, under
considerable and peculiar disadvantages, arising from
extreme youth, inexperience, and the then critical and
disjointed state of the congregation. I entered upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the station with fear and trembling, and with scarce
a peradventure of being able to give any general or
lasting satisfaction. During this interval, I have gone
through many trying afflictions, some of which you
have known, and others, some of the most trying, you
have never known. I have many faults to remember
this day before God, much coldness of heart, many
neglects of duty, and much unfruitfulness in my office;
but I will do you the justice to say, that I have no
injuries from you to enumerate, no personal ill behaviour
from a single individual in all this time to complain
of; and if you had all treated my great Master
with a regard proportioned to that I have received
from you, I should have been the happiest and most
blessed minister on earth," &amp;c.</p>

<p>He closed his days and his ministry together. Apoplectic
seizures had weakened his frame, and at length
had rendered him incapable of fulfilling all the duties
of his office; while they indicated to him that his end
was drawing nigh. In a letter written to his people,
he intimated his wish to have an assistant. They invited
the eldest son of their pastor, then preaching at
Wem, in Shropshire, to become assistant to his father.
This invitation he accepted; but before he entered
on this new sphere of duty, the earthly career of his
beloved and venerated father closed in death. "He
preached on Lord's-day morning, February 25th, 1821,
with much of his usual animation, from Isaiah lxiii.
7-13, and remarked at the close of the discourse what
encouragement this passage affords the widow and the
fatherless to put their trust in God, finishing his last
public discourse with these lines of Doddridge:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"To thee an infant race we leave,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Them may their father's God receive;</span><br />
<span class="i0">That ages yet unborn may raise</span><br />
<span class="i0">Successive hymns of humble praise."</span></div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>
<p>He spent the evening surrounded by his family, and
conversing with his children in a strain of cheerful
piety; and after a night of sound repose arose as well
as usual the next morning. About noon, leaving the
parlour, he was found a few minutes after in an apoplectic
fit, or a seizure resembling apoplexy. Several
medical men repaired to the spot, but life was extinct.</p>

<p>His remains were interred in the ground belonging
to the Meeting House on Thursday, the 8th of March.
On that occasion Mr. Horsey, of Northampton, read
the Scriptures and prayed, and Mr. Edwards, of the
same place, delivered the funeral oration. Mr. Hall,
of Leicester, preached the funeral sermon on the same
day from Heb. xiii. 7&mdash;a sermon which presented a
most impressive representation of the responsibility
attaching to a people that had been favoured with
such a ministry, and the tremendous consequences that
must follow the misimprovement of such advantages.</p>

<p>Mr. Toller only published during his life a sermon
on the "faithful saying," entitled "A Plain and Popular
View of the Evidences of Christianity"; a sermon
occasioned by the death of the Rev. Samuel Palmer,
of Hackney, Mr. Toller's most intimate friend, from
2nd Timothy i. 10&mdash;in which occurs this striking
passage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Suppose this house had been three times its present size,
and had been filled for half the century past with a constant
crowd of hearers; suppose the fame of the venerable man now
gone had been shouted to the skies, and he had been held up
as the pride and prince of preachers; but after all, this had
been <i>all</i>:&mdash;suppose selfish motives had been supreme, under
the disguise of love to souls; a mere notional religion had
been propagated; people had been only amused, and amazed,
and made to wonder and admire; but no minds really instructed,
no hearts humbled, no sinners turned from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
errors of their ways, no Christian graces implanted, no Christian
duties promoted; in this case all these fifty years (as we
have seen) must end; and what is the consequence? What
would all this parade and popularity have proved to him?
Only the bursting of a glittering bubble; the retreat of an
actor from the stage amidst the clappings of the theatre,
which he was to hear no more. There is one passage of Scripture
which, when realized, is worth all the cases of this kind
which could occur put together, viz., when a dying minister
can look round on a weeping, affectionate flock, and say, "Ye
are our epistles, written upon our hearts," &amp;c. I say, the
genuine application of such a passage as this to a dying minister
would be worth infinitely more than all the applause
and popularity in the world.</p></blockquote>

<p>Two discourses, occasioned by the death of the
Princess Charlotte of Wales, were also published.</p>

<p>Since the death of Mr. Toller two volumes of sermons,
and a volume of expository discourses on the
Book of Ruth, have been published, as transcribed
from the Author's shorthand manuscripts. To the
first volume of sermons was prefixed a memoir of Mr.
Toller, by his friend the Rev. R. Hall.</p>

<p>We will transcribe from that memoir an ever-memorable
anecdote, or rather, the ever-memorable use
the preacher made of a domestic incident to illustrate
a most important subject:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>On one occasion he preached from Isaiah xxvii. 4&mdash;"Let
him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with
me; and he shall make peace with me." "I think," said he,
"I can convey the meaning of this passage, so that every one
may understand it, by what took place in my own family
within these few days. One of my little children had committed
a fault, for which I thought it my duty to chastise
him. I called him to me, explained to him the evil of what
he had done, and told him how grieved I was that I must
punish him for it. He heard me in silence, and then rushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
into my arms and burst into tears. I could sooner have cut
off my arm than have then struck him for his fault; he had
'taken hold of my strength, and had made peace with me.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>After the death of Mr. Toller his son was invited
for six months as a probationer for the pastoral office;
at the expiration of that time he received a unanimous
call to that office, which he accepted, and was ordained
in October, 1821, when Messrs. J. Hall, Horsey, Edwards,
Scott, Bull, and Hillyard were engaged in the
principal services of the day. Thus, the eldest son of
the late pastor, who had been educated for the ministry
at the academy at Wymondley, succeeded to the place
of his father in the most harmonious manner, and with
the most cheering prospects of comfort and usefulness.
During the 31 years that have elapsed since then,
that harmony has been uninterrupted, that comfort
and usefulness continued&mdash;the son pursuing a similar
plan to that which the father adopted, in expounding
the Word of God on one part of the Sabbath, to give
enlarged views of Scripture truth, and to present the
almost boundless variety the Book of God contains,
habitually aiming to preserve a connexion between one
part of the Sabbath services and the other. During
the ministry of the present Mr. Toller 211 members
have been added to the Church.</p>

<p>In the year 1849 very extensive alterations were
made in the Meeting House, together with the building
of a new vestry, school-rooms, class-rooms, and a
dwelling-house for the sexton; the whole cost of which
was about 1400, which was paid off within two years
from the re-opening. The place is greatly changed
from what it was. The large chandelier, with its
dove and the olive leaf, is gone; the beautiful gaslight
taking the place of the candles. The old pulpit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
is removed from its place, having long ago lost its
noble sounding-board, it being now understood that
the voice is better heard without such an appendage.
The spacious windows on each side of the pulpit
are lost, to make way for the new school-rooms, which
are open to the Chapel. But the whole, we believe, has
been greatly improved; additional room having been
made for the hearers on the Sabbath, for the week-evening
lecture, and also for the accommodation of
the Sabbath-school, its Bible and its Infant classes.
The present number of Church members is nearly 200;
the scholars in the schools about 280.</p>

<p>Services are conducted in seven villages by members
of the Church, chiefly on Sabbath evenings.</p>

<p>An impartial review of the whole will, we believe,
present to the pastor and the flock the most abundant
reason to "thank God and take courage."</p>

<p>In the history of this Church, we cannot but observe
the very interesting fact which it presents, of 75 years
having been already filled up by the ministry of the father
and the son (and we trust that there is a probability of
years of useful service being added in the case of the
latter to the period that has passed), during which a
Christian society and a numerous congregation have
been preserved in peace, with the interests of vital
religion advancing. While such a fact speaks well for
the spirit and continued improvement of the people, it
says much also for the Christian temper, the consummate
prudence, the able and successful labours
of the pastors, while to God they would unitedly ascribe
all the glory.</p>

<p>At Warkton, about two miles from Kettering, occasional
services are held. In this village Mr. Thomas
Stone, another of the Puritan ministers, was rector&mdash;"a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
person of good learning," it is said, "and great
worth: a zealous Puritan, and a member of the classes."
"He died, an old man and full of days, in the year
1617." Bridges observes, "that he was inducted into
the living of Warkton in the year 1553." If this
statement be correct, he must have been rector of that
place 64 years. He was a learned man, of great uprightness,
and uncommon plainness of spirit, minding
not the things of this world; yet, according to
Wood, "a stiff Nonconformist, and a zealous Presbyterian."
At Geddington, the birth-place of Mr.
Maidwell, the first pastor of the Independent Church
at Kettering, there is a Chapel regularly supplied on
the Sabbath evenings. This place of worship was
provided by Mr. Nathaniel Collis, for many years a
respectable bookseller in Kettering, and a deacon of
the Church&mdash;Geddington was his native place.</p>

<p>Services are also conducted on Sabbath evenings at
Great Oakley, five miles from Kettering; occasionally
at Orlingbury, five miles in another direction; also at
Thorpe and Loddington.</p>


<h3>BROUGHTON.</h3>

<p>The Dissenters of Kettering have conducted occasional
services in the village of Broughton, about three
miles distant on the road for Northampton, for many
years past. But rather more than five years ago, there
were four or five young men in this village who began
to think of the things which belonged to their everlasting
peace; they formed themselves into a little band,
and resolved that they would meet weekly and study
the holy Scriptures, and encourage each other in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
ways of God. They subsequently joined a Christian
Church at Kettering. Becoming anxious for the welfare
of those around them, they had a cottage licensed
for preaching; that was found too small for those who
wished to attend. In the meantime several other
Christian friends came to the village, and at length, in
the year 1850, a Chapel was erected; it is a neat structure,
capable of containing about 200 hearers. In
January, 1851, a Christian Church was formed, consisting
of 19 persons; Mr. Toller and Mr. Robinson,
of Kettering, being present, and conducting the services.
This village Church is formed on the broad
principle of Christian union, designated simply a
Christian Church, without denominational distinction;
its present number of communicants is 22. There is
preaching here on the afternoon and evening of the
Sabbath, by friends from Kettering and other places.
An interesting Sabbath-school is conducted, numbering
more than 60 children. The teachers express the
earnest desire that many of them may be gathered into
the fold of Christ, and become useful in their generation.</p>

<p>This place was once noted as the residence of the
eminent Puritan divine, Robert Bolton, B.D. He was
presented to the rectory in the year 1609, and continued
until his death, in 1631. It is stated concerning
him, that "he was a most authoritative and
awakening preacher, being endowed with the most
masculine and oratorical style of any in his time;" that
"he was so deeply engaged in his work, that he never
delivered a sermon to his people in public till he had
preached it to himself in private."</p>

<p>"His remains were interred in the chancel of
Broughton Church, where there is a half-length figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of him with his hands erected in the attitude of
prayer, resting on a book lying open before him; and
underneath is a monumental inscription in black marble,
of which the following is a translation:"&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
Here lies,<br />
peaceably sleeping in the Lord,<br />
the body of Robert Bolton,<br />
who died December the seventeenth,<br />
in the year 1631.<br />
He was one of the first and<br />
most learned of our Church.<br />
His other excellencies all England knoweth,<br />
lamenting the day of his death.
</div>

<p>Mr. Bolton published a number of works; those
most known in the present day are his 'Directions
for Walking with God,' and his 'Four Lost Things.'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>MEMORIALS OF THE INDEPENDENT CHURCH AT
MARKET HARBOROUGH.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></h3>


<p>If a stranger were passing through the small but
respectable town of Market Harborough, on the road
to Leicester, with the intention of observing what was
most worthy of notice, he would see on the right of the
principal street, in the upper part of the town, a handsome
structure, of considerable dimensions for the
size of the place. On the front of the building he
might notice the inscription&mdash;"Independent Chapel."
If an intelligent traveller, he would think, Surely this
was not the first origin of Independency here! This
must have been erected for a body of some standing in
the town. On inquiry, he would find that there had
been an old Meeting House, which had stood at the
top of the lane leading for Great Bowden for more
than 150 years, during the whole of which period a
numerous and respectable body of Dissenters had assembled
in it; but that the building, with its plain
walls, its high pews, its deep galleries, its antique
pillars, and irregular form, had been entirely taken
down; and this Chapel, in a more eligible position,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
had been raised by the present congregation. And he
might be informed that it was nobly done; for after
the most liberal subscriptions, amounting to 1600,
a moiety of which was lost by the failure of the bank
in which they were deposited: (in consequence of
this, an appeal was made to the public, the result of
which about made up the loss sustained:) the whole
amount that remained to complete the cost was raised
on the day of opening; the sum expended in the erection
of the Chapel exceeding 3000.</p>

<p>From this introductory statement, we shall lead the
reader back to the early history of this cause.</p>

<p>In looking backward for 190 years, we find that by
the "Act of Uniformity," passed in the year 1662,
Mr. Thomas Lowry was ejected from the Church in
this place. Though we have no record of his life or
his labours, beyond the statement "that he was a
native of Scotland, and had a living in Essex before
he came to Harborough," yet by his Nonconformity
he teaches us that he had embraced principles which
led him to refuse to bow to the dictates of men in the
things of God, and which prompted him rather to
sacrifice his worldly interests than what related to
truth and a good conscience.</p>

<p>The probability is, that some of the people to whom
he had ministered would become Nonconformists with
their pastor; but whether he obtained any opportunities
of preaching to them after his ejectment is
not known. Subsequent events lead us to the conclusion
that the principles of Nonconformity must have
obtained a number of adherents in Harborough and
its vicinity; because we find that, eleven years after
the passing of the "Act of Uniformity" (<i>i.e.</i>, in the
year 1673), Mr. Matthew Clarke became the stated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
pastor of an Independent congregation here. This
brings before us the first clear and certain information
relative to the early history of this cause in Harborough.</p>

<p>A short distance from Leicester lies the village of
Narborough, where, at the restoration of Charles II.,
Mr. Matthew Clarke was the rector; the living being
worth at that time about 120 per annum. His father
and grandfather had both been ministers in the Church.
He was educated, under the best masters, with a view
to the profession&mdash;first, in the Charter House, in London;
afterwards, under Dr. Busby, at Westminster;
and under Dr. Temple, at Trinity College, Cambridge.
He was a diligent student; became eminent for his
scholarship: but what was still more important, he
became early devoted to God; associated himself with
some students who were remarkable for piety, and
who engaged in such exercises as tended to prepare
for the work of the Christian ministry, for which they
were designed. He obtained the degree of M.A.</p>

<p>He was presented to the living of Narborough in
1657. After pursuing his labours there for five years,
he was ejected as a Nonconformist. He was earnestly
pressed to conformity by Mr. Stratford, the patron of
the living, but could not by any means bring his conscience
to a compliance with what the law required.
For conscience' sake he was a sufferer. Devoted to
his work, he took every opportunity of preaching the
Gospel in Leicestershire and parts adjacent. He was
watched narrowly by some furious justices of the
peace; and though he had the happiness often to
escape, yet he was three times a prisoner in Leicester
Gaol, for the crime of preaching the Gospel! After
dwelling for a time in a lone house in Leicester Forest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and being driven from thence by the "Five Mile Act" to
Stoke Golding, he was invited to Harborough, where
he came and settled in 1673; and had a large congregation.
This appears to have been the first and the
permanent settlement of Protestant Nonconformists of
congregational principles in this place.</p>

<p>In connexion with Harborough, Mr. Clarke also
took the charge of a congregation meeting at Ashley,
a village about five miles from the former place; and
during the whole course of his subsequent ministry he
regularly preached at Ashley in the morning, and at
Harborough in the afternoon, every Lord's-day. His
ministry appears to have been highly valued, and to
have been eminently successful; at the close of it the
Church numbered 202 members, a very large proportion
of them living in the villages surrounding Harborough&mdash;some
of them a number of miles distant.
In the character of Mr. Clarke were combined unbending
integrity and conscientiousness, with great kindness
of spirit and manner. Of the first we have proof
in his decided Nonconformity&mdash;in his willingness to
suffer rather than to sin&mdash;in his following the path of
duty, whatever might be the dangers to which it exposed
him&mdash;in his steady pursuit of all the labours of
his calling until laid aside by his last affliction&mdash;in his
firm resistance of acts of injustice and oppression, as
shown when, being convinced that the King's tax
on his salary was unjust, he firmly and successfully
refused payment: of the latter we have proof in
his affectionate regard to the truly pious wherever
he beheld them&mdash;in the peaceful temper which he
breathed&mdash;in the kind and profitable intercourse he
promoted between his brethren&mdash;and in the conciliatory
spirit he manifested towards those who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the enemies of the Gospel, or of the cause he supported.</p>

<p>Mr. Clarke had one son, named after him, who for
a time became an assistant to his father in the work of
the ministry at Harborough. The venerable father
contrived, amidst all that he suffered for conscience'
sake (and he drank largely of the bitter cup), to take
peculiar care of the education of his son, whom he
early instructed in the learned languages, together
with several young persons who were studying under
his tuition for the ministry.</p>

<p>The parent's wish to see his son a preacher of the
same Gospel for which he was suffering was honourable
to himself, but it seems to have led him to
devote that son to the work without waiting to see
whether God approved; which, but for the grace
bestowed upon the youth, might have been a fatal
injury to himself and thousands more. After revolving
the question seriously in his mind, and reflecting
on the sacrifices which the ministry would require,
the son was at length animated to comply with the
father's desire, by the consideration that they that
"turn many to righteousness shall shine as the stars
for ever and ever."</p>

<p>On examining his own religious character, he said
that he had endured much distress because he could
not discern that remarkable change which many
had experienced; still, however, he dreaded above
all things a hypocritical profession; and though
at first he thought his abstinence from sin, as well
as his attention to secret prayer and other duties,
might have arisen from a fear of offending his parents,
yet he trusted that at last they sprang from the principle
of love to God.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>After he had acquired, not only Latin and Greek,
but also several of the Oriental languages, in which
his father possessed uncommon skill, and had added to
them a familiar acquaintance with Italian and French,
he went to study for the ministry under Mr. Woodhouse,
a celebrated teacher in Shropshire. From
thence he removed to London; and having joined a
Church there, and heard several of the most celebrated
preachers, he returned to Leicestershire, where
he began his ministry as assistant to his father,
amidst the storm that raged in the year 1684. He
was so useful that very large additions were made
to his father's Church while he was with him. "When
he was present," says Mr. Neal, "at the declaration
which the new converts made of the powerful impressions
received under his ministry, oh, how he would
humble and abase himself before God in prayer, and
set the crown of his success upon the head of free
grace!" During the first three years of his ministry
he also laid the foundation of several congregations
in that country. He was in 1687 called to preach at
Sandwich, in Kent, where he was detained by the
importunity of those who derived benefit from his
labours; but after two years was recalled by the equal
solicitations of his father and the flock in Leicestershire.
But though he then settled with them, they
were compelled by a sense of duty to give him up
almost immediately, for, having preached an occasional
sermon in London, he was invited to assist Mr. Ford
in Miles' Lane. This was his final removal from Harborough.
After Mr. Ford's death he became the
sole pastor of the Church, was the means of changing
a declining cause into one of the most prosperous
Churches in London, and attained a very high degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of popularity and usefulness, which were maintained
by the divine blessing even to the close of his life.
With the inspiration of friendship added to that of
genius, Dr. Walls composed a Latin epitaph, which
was inscribed on his tomb in Bunhill-fields; and at
the request of friends he gave an English translation,
which would furnish an eloquent and spirited memoir
of the deceased. This epitaph we insert here, because
Harborough was the scene of his youthful days, his
early education, his decided piety, and his first stated
engagements in the ministry, which were so excellent
and successful as to give promise of all the future eminence
he attained. It may be found in the last volume
of Watts's Works, page 439.</p>

<p>The elder Mr. Clarke continued his labours at Harborough
and Ashley, until he was seized with palsy
on one side; after which, perceiving that his work
was done, and his end drawing nigh, he removed to
his daughter's (Mrs. Allen, of Norwich), where he
died, about 1708, nearly 80 years of age.</p>

<p>There is preserved, in the handwriting of Mr.
Some, a copy of a Church covenant, that appears,
from its early date, to have been adopted during Mr.
Clarke's ministry. Being one of the oldest of the
kind, and very concise, we think it deserves to be
transcribed and inserted here.</p>

<blockquote><p>We do solemnly, in the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ,
"who walks in the midst of the golden candlesticks; who
hath his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet like fine brass,"
declare, that by the grace of God we will henceforward endeavour
to reform whatever is amiss amongst us, according to
the best understanding we have of the holy Scriptures, which
we believe to be the only rule of faith and worship; humbly
avouching the Lord to be our God, and humbly hoping that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
he hath avouched us, though most unworthy, to be his people.
Subscribed May 30th, 1690.</p></blockquote>

<p>The persevering labours, the consistent character,
the extended efforts, and important influence of Mr.
Clarke in this situation, appear in the members that
composed the Church, as before stated, and 172 of
whom were gathered from about 30 villages in the
vicinity. The village Chapels being few in number
in those days, the Nonconformists travelled from the
places around to assemble for worship at Harborough
and Ashley, as the centres where, on the Lord's-day,
they could meet together.</p>

<p>The next pastor of the Church is one concerning
whom the language is verified, that "the memory of
the just is blessed"; for though the modesty and deep
humility of Mr. Some were such that he forbade any
memorials being published of his life and character,
and before his death destroyed all his papers that presented
anything of this kind, yet his name is mentioned
with great veneration and esteem to this day.
It appears probable that he was assistant or co-pastor
with Mr. Clarke a short time before the close of his
labours; that he came to Harborough about the year
1706, as his name stands in the first trust deed of
Ashley Meeting House about that time, as the recognized
minister of both places. He took the sole pastoral
charge in 1709, as he then entered the names of all the
members of the Church in a book, which he preserved.
He united the pastorate of Ashley with Harborough,
and laboured at both places in the manner of his predecessor,
connecting with them also a considerable extent
of village itineracy, by which his character was much
endeared and his ministry greatly blest.</p>

<p>Mr. Some had one son, who was training for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
ministry, but who died before he fully entered on the
work. He was for a time a fellow-student with Doddridge,
and became his most intimate friend; so that,
immediately after his death, Doddridge writes to Mr.
Clarke, of St. Albans&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>It pleased God, in the afternoon of yesterday, to take away
my dear companion and brother, Mr. Some. There was no
person in the world of his age whom I respected more or
loved so well. At the academy we were partners in study;
and since I came to Harborough he would, when his health
would permit it, take frequent journeys with me to Kibworth
on the Lord's-day. And what sweet counsel have we taken
together when "we went to the house of God in company!"
I have been informed of some of his expressions of respect
and tenderness for me, which affect me exceedingly. He has
ordered me to preach his funeral sermon from Psalm lxxiii.
26: "My flesh and my heart fail me, but God is the strength
of my heart, and my portion for ever." But my mind is so
shattered with grief, and mine eyes filled with tears, that I
hardly know how to read or write.</p></blockquote>

<p>In another letter he says: "Mr. Some, though he
appears to feel it like a parent, yet supports himself
under it with a serenity and fortitude worthy of so
excellent a Christian and minister."</p>

<p>The eminence to which Mr. Some attained, and the
success of his ministry, is partly attested by the fact
that 270 persons were added to the Church during his
pastoral labours.</p>

<p>Doddridge came to reside at Harborough while
minister at Kibworth, to enjoy the society and friendship
of Mr. Some. In the year 1729 he became his
assistant, taking services alternately at Kibworth,
Harborough, and Ashley; and by the earnest advice of
Mr. Some he commenced his academy at Harborough.</p>

<p>When the Dissenting ministers in the neighbourhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
agreed to meet at Lutterworth, to spend a day
in humiliation and prayer for the revival of religion,
Mr. Some preached upon that occasion a very important
appropriate discourse&mdash;from Rev. iii. 2: "Be
watchful and strengthen the things which remain, that
are ready to die"&mdash;"On the methods to be taken by
ministers for the revival of religion." He also published
a very excellent funeral sermon for Mr. Saunders,
of Kettering, from the text he had chosen, 1st
Cor. xv. 10: "Not I, but the grace of God which
was with me."</p>

<p>We have further discovered a small volume of 56
pages, entitled 'The Assembly's Catechism Explained,
and the principles of religion therein contained confirmed
by the Holy Scriptures, by David Some. Second
edition, 1727.' It has an interesting preface, a
part of which we shall copy, as illustrative of the
views entertained by this eminent man, and the methods
he adopted for the improvement of the rising
generation.</p>

<blockquote><p>The design of the following pages is to render public catechising
easy and profitable.</p>

<p>When young persons see a great deal before them, which
they are required to commit to memory, they soon grow weary
of this exercise, and find excuses to absent themselves from
it. This difficulty is removed by the narrow limits of this
essay.</p>

<p>I fear there are many in all our assemblies "who need to
be taught the first principles of the oracles of God," and yet
their age and circumstances prevent their submitting to this
way of instruction. There is a particular regard had to these
in this composure. The questions are so framed that there is
room for enlarging upon them, as the importance of the argument
may require. The treating upon the heads of divinity
in this way insensibly leads into a freedom and easiness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
expression, which is hard to attain in a more set and continued
discourse: this hath the more direct tendency to
inform the judgment and fix the attention. I have seldom
observed a drowsy hearer whilst I have been engaged in this
part of my work; I wish I could say so of the other parts
of it.</p>

<p>I hope I need not make any apology for adding the Scriptures;
this will be acceptable to everyone who values them.
Besides, this will acquaint children betimes with their Bibles,
and teach them that their religion is derived from that sacred
book as the fountain of it. * * * * * * If any should condemn the whole of this undertaking as
paying too great a regard to human composures, I can assure
them that I have long since learned to call no man master
upon earth. I have not attempted to explain the doctrines
contained in this Catechism because it was composed by that
learned body of men, the assembly of divines, but because
I verily believe that for the substance of them they are
agreeable to the word of God. I was early instructed in
them, and have now reviewed them with some attention and
care, lest the prejudices of education should have been the
principal reason of my adherence to them; and after the
most impartial search, I cannot discover anything so absurd
and inconsistent in this scheme of religion as some have
represented: and I hope I may be allowed the liberty of judging
for myself.</p>

<p>I am fully convinced of the usefulness of public catechising,
by more than twenty years' experience. I have seen the good
effects of it, and purpose to allow it a share in my public
labours while God continues life and a capacity for service;
and if any of my worthy brethren shall make use of this
weak performance, I heartily wish that the divine blessing
may attend their endeavours to promote real religion and
practical godliness.</p>

<div class="signature">D. S.</div></blockquote>

<p>As a specimen of the method he adopted, we present
to the reader the short section "of assurance and
other blessings."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><i>Q.</i> What are the benefits which in this life do either accompany
or flow from justification, adoption, and sanctification?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The benefits which do either accompany or flow from
justification, adoption, and sanctification, are assurance of
God's love, peace of conscience, joy in the Holy Ghost, increase
of grace, and perseverance therein to the end.</p>

<p>May true believers be assured of God's love? Yes. (Rom.
v. 5.) "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts."
May they have peace of conscience? Yes. (Rom. xv. 13.)
"The God of hope fill you with all peace in believing." May
they have joy? Yes. (Rom. v. 11.) "We also joy in God."
Is the Holy Ghost the author of it? Yes. (Gal. v. 22.)
"The fruit of the Spirit is joy." Shall true Christians grow
in grace? Yes. (Prov. iv. 18.) "The path of the just shineth
more and more unto the perfect day." Is perseverance
the Christian's duty? Yes. (Phil. iii. 14.) "I press towards
the mark." And their privilege? Yes. (1st Peter i. 5.)
"Who are kept by the power of God, through faith unto salvation."
What may we infer from hence? I. That religion
is not a melancholy thing. (Prov. iii. 17.) "Her ways are
ways of pleasantness." II. Growth in grace is an evidence
of the truth of it. (Mark iv. 8.) "Others fell on good
ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased."
III. That weak Christians should not be discouraged.</p></blockquote>

<p>When his death occurred, Doddridge wrote&mdash;"It is
to my unutterable grief that I hear this day that our
dear friend, Mr. Some, is dead. I hardly know how
to bear it." Again: "We know in whose hands our
lives are, and those of our friends who remain&mdash;a soul-quieting
thought, which I would apply to the unspeakable
loss I have sustained in the death of that great
and good man, that invaluable friend, Mr. Some,
whom I honoured and loved as a parent."</p>

<p>Mr. Barker, of Hackney, wrote&mdash;"The death of the
excellent person you have lately lost afflicts me greatly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
There are few such ministers anywhere, and few such
men in any age. I know that his modesty was excessive,
but am sorry to find that it has deprived us of
those memoirs, which, touched over by your hand,
would have been very instructive and entertaining;
but if we must not read his life and character, let us
remember and imitate his exemplary piety, prudence,
and diligence. This truly revered and excellent man
died May 27th, 1737. God was pleased to favour him
with a serene and cheerful exit, suited to the eminent
piety and usefulness of his life. "I am well satisfied,"
remarks Doddridge, "that considering how very generally
he was known, he has left a most honourable
testimony, in the hearts of thousands, that he was one
of the brightest ornaments of the Gospel and the ministry
which the age has produced; and that all who
have had any intimacy with him must have esteemed
his friendship amongst the greatest blessings of life,
and the loss of him amongst its greatest calamities."</p>

<p>An interesting memorial exists, written by Mr.
Some, which shows the method he adopted in admitting
candidates to the Church; clearly indicating what
he considered their qualifications should be; what was
the nature of the connexion they were about to form;
and with what spirit and purpose they should unite
themselves to the society to which they desired to be
admitted.</p>

<blockquote><div class="center"><i>Questions to be addressed to Candidates for Communion.</i></div>

<p>1. Wherefore do you desire communion with this Church?</p>

<p>2. Will you endeavour to walk circumspectly and peaceably
amongst us, as it becomes a disciple of the Lord Jesus
Christ?</p>

<p>3. Will you attend upon the ministry and ordinances of
this Church as often as you can?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>4. Do you purpose to stand by us, and steadfastly to adhere
to us, if times of difficulty and trial should come?</p>

<p>5. Do you therefore, in the presence of God and his people
here assembled, give up yourself to the watch and care of this
Church, promising to submit to the discipline that is exercised
therein, so far as it is agreeable to the mind of Christ
revealed in his word? If these be your designs, then in the
name of our blessed Redeemer, and with the consent and
approbation of this Church, I open the doors thereof for your
admittance into it, and declare you a member of it, earnestly
desiring that God would bless you in it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Towards the close of Mr. Some's ministry the
Chapel House was purchased of Walter Renals, and
bought by Knightley Holland, for the use of the minister
for the time being.</p>

<p>In the year 1844 this house was taken down, and
the new Chapel erected near to the spot where it had
stood; for some years before it having ceased to be
occupied by the minister of the place.</p>

<p>After Doddridge removed to Northampton, as Mr.
Some, through the failure of his strength, was incompetent
to undertake the whole of the services devolving
on him, he was provided with another assistant
in 1730, in Mr. J. Halford, a native of Northampton,
who, though he never enjoyed the advantages of an
academical education, possessed good natural talents.
He remained until 1734, when he removed to Horselydown.
After the removal of Mr. Halford, Mr. Some
had no other assistant to the day of his death, but
most probably restricted his labours. He died in the
57th year of his age; "and," said this holy man of
God with his dying breath, "If any ask how David
Some died, let it be answered, that he sought and
found mercy." Dr. Doddridge preached his funeral
sermon, after his remains had been interred in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
chancel of the parish church of Great Bowden. The
knowledge of the spot is only preserved by tradition,
which must be attributed to that fatal modesty which
induced him in his last moments to commit his writings
to the flames. His best earthly memorial is in the
affection and reverence with which his name has been
so long cherished.</p>

<p>After the death of Mr. Some we find an unsettled
interval of fifteen years, during which many changes
took place; and no records were preserved by the
Church of the events that occurred, or of the state of
things amongst them.</p>

<p>We learn from the correspondence of Doddridge,
that the year after the death of Mr. Some, Mr. Toaker
received an invitation of such a pressing nature to
become the pastor of the Church at Harborough, that
he was constrained to accept the call; but two years
after this he speaks of the ordination of one of his
students, Mr. Isaac Wilkinson, over the Church at
Harborough, being fixed to take place May 9th, 1740.
Then again, in a letter written to Dr. Clarke, of St.
Albans, February 27th, 1741, he speaks of Ashley and
Harborough as being vacant.</p>

<p>In the list of Doddridge's students, given at the
close of the last volume of his 'Correspondence,' we
have the names of Samuel Smalley, as settled at Harborough,
who entered the academy in 1737; and
of Jabez Hirons, as minister at Harborough, who entered
the academy in 1745. All that we can gather
from these statements is, that the congregation was
during this period in a very unsettled state, not having
become united for any length of time under any
pastor, or having anyone to settle peacefully and usefully
over them until the year 1752, when a pleasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
change took place in the choice of Mr. Stephen
Addington.</p>

<p>It appears that Mr. Addington was a native of
Northampton, and a student under Dr. Doddridge, by
whom he was treated with all the kindness of a father.
He commenced his labours at Spaldwick, Huntingdonshire.
He had not, however, been there more than
two years before this situation was offered to his acceptance,
which had been chosen and marked out for him
in the wishes, at least, of his foster parent. The following
circumstance led to the appointment: Upon the
resignation of a pastor who had never felt himself at
home among the people, their choice was divided
between two persons, who had been proposed by their
respective friends. At length it was wisely agreed by
both parties to withdraw their suffrages from each in
favour of a third candidate, if one could be found who
should be agreeable to the whole congregation. At
this juncture Mr. Addington was recommended to
them by the Rev. Mr. Gilbert, of Oakhampton, and
in 1752 received a unanimous invitation to settle
amongst them. Accordingly, in the month of July he
removed to Harborough, and established himself in the
very house where his good friend had lived. He was
ordained in September, 1753, on which occasion the
service was conducted by the Rev. Mr. Gilbert, of
Northampton, Mr. Goodrich, of Oundle, Mr. Boyce,
of Kettering, Mr. Gregson, of Rowell, and Dr. Ashworth,
of Daventry.</p>

<p>The first five years of Mr. Addington's residence
were devoted exclusively to the duties of his pastoral
office. His congregation was considerable, and some
of them came from a distance of several miles; but
the Church at Ashley had now a pastor of its own, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
as no longer to require the stated engagements of the
minister at Harborough.</p>

<p>So entirely did Mr. Addington appear to possess the
confidence and affections of his people, that he became
scarcely less their friend and counsellor in their various
secular concerns than their spiritual guide and instructor.
The leading object of all his plans was their
moral and religious improvement. In pursuance of
this great design, it was Mr. Addington's custom to distribute
and associate as many of his people as he could
into classes, according to their age, sex, and situation.
In these societies they were in the habit of meeting at
stated times for prayer and religious converse, often
attended by their minister; the societies were always
under his superintendence, and once in every year
(about Christmas) each of them spent a comfortable
evening together at his house. Even the female
servants had their annual day, on which, after assembling
in the Meeting House, and spending a part of
the afternoon in cleaning it, they partook of a social
and friendly entertainment provided for them.</p>

<p>Mr. Addington's labours among his people were
both acceptable, and beneficial to the great purposes of
the Christian ministry. His strain of preaching was
chiefly practical and experimental, and his delivery
animated and affectionate. But beside his many ministerial
and pastoral engagements, Mr. Addington at
length added the arduous undertaking of a boarding-school,
in which he succeeded the Rev. Mr. Token, of
Kibworth, whose school was removed to Harborough.
During a part also of this period he extended his pastoral
charge to the congregation at Kibworth. At
this time he was by no means a strong and healthy
man; and after continuing his exertions of one kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
or another for nearly thirty years, he began to find
some failure in his energy and activity; and under
this impression it seemed prudent to contract the sphere
of his duties. Whilst preparing to carry his design
into effect, circumstances occurred which eventually
issued in his removal; the active part which he took
in the politics of the day somewhat affecting both his
usefulness and his comfort towards the close of his
residence at Harborough. While he was thus circumstanced,
he received an invitation to a charge in Miles
Lane, London, which determined his removal in October,
1781. It was not, however, without the severest
struggle that he resigned a connexion that had long
been endeared to him by almost everything calculated
to produce and to cherish reciprocally in the parties
the most cordial esteem and the liveliest affection.
The connexion might indeed not be said to have been
broken up, but exchanged for an intimacy differing
only in the mode and in the degree of its friendship,
and which continued to the end of his days.</p>

<p>After Mr. Addington's removal from Harborough,
he became tutor of an academy first established at
Mile End, which afterwards existed at Hoxton, and
then at Highbury.</p>

<p>"The friends of evangelical truth, lamenting the
heterodoxy or coldness of another seminary, associated
to provide for the Churches pastors of a different
spirit. At first they engaged some ministers of established
reputation for piety and orthodox sentiments,
to give lectures at their own houses to such young men
as were selected from the Churches in London and its
vicinity. This mode, however, soon proved so inconvenient
that they were compelled to provide in 1783 a
building at Mile End, to which they invited Stephen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Addington, minister of Market Harborough, as tutor
of what was now called 'the Evangelical Academy.'
The friends of the institution procured him a diploma
of Doctor of Divinity; but as he had lately relinquished
a similar charge under the impression of declining
vigour, he had scarcely begun to 'gird up the loins of
his mind' to the duties of his new office with the hope
of extensive usefulness, before he was attacked by a
severe indisposition, which laid him aside for some
time. Though he recovered beyond expectation, and
resumed his labours with new ardour, he was again
disabled by affliction, and at length compelled to resign
his office as tutor in 1789.</p>

<p>"As he had been chosen pastor of the congregation
in Miles Lane, he continued to labour there under the
pressure of infirmities, but encouraged by the generous
attachment of his flock, for years after he resigned his
academical charge."</p>

<p>In February, 1796, he was called away from his
labours and trials by death, in his sixty-seventh year.
"He was an amiable man, of correct deportment, ardent
piety, and zeal for usefulness. His learning was extensive
rather than profound; he projected more works
than he found time to execute; and his dread of living
in vain induced him to grasp at objects to which his
strength was inadequate. As a preacher, he was more
esteemed than admired, for his elocution was defective,
though earnest; and his thoughts, always good, were
seldom great. His 'Treatise in Defence of Infant
Baptism,' and his 'Life of the Apostle Paul,' are the
best known among his publications, of which our limits
will not allow us to give the full list."&mdash;So write the
authors of the 'History of Dissenters,' Vol. <span class="smcap">iv.</span>, p. 264.</p>

<p>Of the 'Treatise on Baptism,' Job Orton says&mdash;"Addington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
hath lately published a small piece upon
it, which I think comprehends everything valuable that
hath been written."</p>

<p>A dedication to his congregation at Harborough is
prefixed to this Treatise, from which we make the
following extract:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">My dear Friends</span>,&mdash;You have, in the following pages, the
result of a free and serious inquiry into the Scripture doctrine
of Christian baptism. After reading many controversial tracts
on the mode and subjects of this ordinance, I found myself
obliged to examine the sacred pages before I could be
thoroughly satisfied either as to the manner or time of life
in which it ought to be administered. Previous to this
inquiry, I endeavoured to divest myself of every prejudice,
and determined to follow the truth whithersoever it might
lead me. Far be it from me to assert that I have nowhere
mistaken the language of the Holy Spirit in the several
passages that either give an account of the administration
of Christian baptism or tend to explain the nature and
design of the institution; but this I hope I can say, that
I have endeavoured to enter into the true meaning of them,
and have explained them in a sense that appears to me
(upon the maturest consideration) most consistent and scriptural.
I think myself obliged to tell you, that the inquiry
has afforded me abundant satisfaction. The reasons for our
practice of baptising children, and that by sprinkling or
pouring of water, appear to me now in a much stronger light
than before; and I am more fully convinced than ever that
the specious objections that are thrown out against it have
no solid foundation in reason or the word of God.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is dated, Harborough, September 6th, 1770.</p>

<p>The interval was not very long from the resignation
of Mr. Addington to the settlement of Mr. Gill, as Mr.
Addington's resignation is dated August 12, 1781,
and Mr. Gill commenced his labours in the early part
of 1782. During the interval the pulpit was supplied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
by neighbouring ministers, and the students from the
academy at Daventry; among the latter of whom was
Mr. Belsham, afterwards recognized as the champion
of Socinianism. The principal candidates were Mr.
Bennett, who afterwards settled at Kiderminster;
Mr. Cooke, who finally settled at Halifax; and a Mr.
Severn. During this state of indecision, Mr. Garner,
in his travels into Yorkshire, heard of Mr. Gill, who,
being highly recommended as an excellent man, was
introduced to the Church at Harborough.</p>

<p>Mr. Gill was a native of Netherthong, a small village
near Holesfirth, in Yorkshire. He was educated at
the academy at Heckmondwicke, and commenced his
labours at Swanland, not far from Hull. After a
residence of about eight or nine years in that place, he
was invited to the pastoral office over this Church and
congregation. Mr. Gill's acceptance of the invitation
is dated March 22nd, 1782. Mr. Gill continued his
labours after this union for a long period, with honour
to himself and benefit to others. He was permitted to
preach the Gospel to them for more than six-and-thirty
years, while he lived among them for at least half a
century. A paralytic affection rendered it necessary
that he should retire from his labours and resign his
charge, in the year 1818. In the interval between
this period and his death, he was, with the exception
of the time he spent at Coventry with a son, regular in
his attendance at the Meeting where he had ministered;
and though all the powers of his mind were much impaired,
his relish for the word was undiminished, and
his habits of devotion never left him to his dying hour.</p>

<p>This holy and venerable servant of God breathed his
last at the house of his son-in-law, Mr. French, of Great
Bowden, on the evening of February 2nd, 1832, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the age of 79. He was buried in the ground connected
with the Meeting, when Mr. Wild delivered
the funeral oration; Mr. Bicknell, of Crick, and Mr.
Robertson, of Wellingborough, engaged in prayer; Mr.
Chater, of Kibworth, giving out the hymns. His
funeral sermon was preached on the Sabbath following,
by Mr. Scott, of Rowell, from Acts xi. 24:
"He was a good man," &amp;c. (the character of Barnabas).
During the ministry of Mr. Gill 248 members were
added to the Church.</p>

<p>Having some recollections of Mr. Gill's person and
ministry, from having heard him a few times in the
latter part of his labours, in his own place of worship
and in neighbouring places, we should describe him as
rather above the middle stature; very grave in his
aspect; his manners gentle and kind; his spirit devotional
and fervent; always serious in his work; his
matter plain, pious, experimental, decidedly evangelical
in sentiment: his voice was not of great compass.
Mr. Gill was not distinguished by grasp of
mind, power of reasoning, depth of thought, or extent
of information. His powers, whether natural or acquired,
were not of a high order. His case shows us
what may be done by the weight of character, fervent
consistent piety, without superior mental endowments,
in filling a respectable station with credit and usefulness.
Mr. Gill was considered to be exemplary in
visiting his flock, and to this was added the care of
a considerable boarding-school, which he had for a
number of years; and our impression is, that more
time was spent in such engagements than could comport
with the efficient discharge of the duties of the
pulpit. Hence we fear, from what was manifested in
the state of the Church and congregation after his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
retirement, that the result of his labours was not of
the most satisfactory kind.</p>

<p>On the resignation of Mr. Gill, Mr. Jukes, now of
Bedford, supplied Harborough for many months with
great acceptance. Mr. Francis, of Lancaster, also came
as a candidate for a short time.</p>

<p>Mr. Gear, now of Bradford, Wiltshire, then a student
at Hoxton Academy, succeeded as a probationer,
and was invited by a large majority to take the oversight
of the Church. The want of entire unanimity
led Mr. Gear at first to decline accepting the invitation;
but, upon its being renewed, he ultimately complied
with the call, and was ordained to the pastoral office
in October, 1822. The ministers engaged were Messrs.
Notcutt, of Wilbarston, now of Ipswich; Robertson,
of Stretton, afterwards of Wellingborough; Maslem,
of Hertford, Mr. Gear's pastor; Dr. Harris, of Hoxton,
Mr. Gear's tutor; Scott, of Rowell, now tutor of Airedale
Academy; Green, of Uppingham; and Roberts, of
Melton.</p>

<p>Mr. Gear continued his labours at Harborough until
the year 1830, when, not finding that concord and
good feeling between him and the people necessary for
each other's mutual advantage and happiness, he complied
with an invitation he received from Bradford, in
Wiltshire. Letters were addressed to him signed by
375 persons, urging his stay at Harborough, but he
declined to do so. After his departure, a handsome
gift of plate was presented to him, as a memorial of
esteem and affection from his numerous friends.</p>

<p>Mr. Gear's removal, and a difference of opinion
concerning the candidates which were recommended
and heard, led to considerable altercation and painful
division of feeling. The following ministers supplied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the pulpit as probationers: Mr. Johnson, from Highbury;
Mr. Wooldridge, from Gideon Chapel, Bristol;
Mr. Hewlett, late of Newberry. Mr. Slye, of Potterspury,
was unanimously invited to visit Harborough
as a probationer; but, having no desire to remove from
his people, refused.</p>

<p>Mr. Wild, late of Gainsborough, and educated under
Mr. Joseph Fletcher, of Blackburn, was recommended
to the friends at Harborough by Dr. Raffles, of Liverpool.
In May, 1831, Mr. Wild was invited to spend
three or four Sabbaths, at the expiration of which
time he received an invitation to the pastoral office;
but conceiving the time he had spent among them too
limited to form a just opinion of the people and the
suitabilities of the place, he engaged to spend a month
or five weeks more before he gave his final answer to
the wishes of the people. Mr. Wild accepted the invitation,
and his recognition as the pastor took place
November 9th of the same year. Dr. Raffles, of Liverpool;
Scott, of Rowell; Toller, of Kettering; Roberts,
of Melton; Chater, of Kibworth; Hewlett, of Lutterworth,
engaged in the services of the day.</p>

<p>Mr. Wild's ministry here was of short duration, and
attended with the want of unanimity and peace; so
that in the year 1835, perceiving the continuance of
dissatisfaction, with no prospect as he thought of party
feeling abating, and consequently little hope of future
comfort and usefulness, he sent a notice of his intention
to resign, which was read by Mr. Hobson, of
Welford, on Lord's-day, January 11th, 1835, his ministry
having continued about three years and a half.</p>

<p>The present pastor (Mr. H. Toller) is the fifth
surviving son of the late Rev. T. N. Toller, of Kettering.
He pursued a course of preparatory study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
under Mr. Walter Scott, late of Rowell; and afterwards
was a student at Coward College, London. At
the expiration of his studies, he was invited as a
probationer to Harborough, and ultimately to take the
pastoral charge, which he accepted, and was ordained
October 27th, 1836. His brother, Mr. Thomas Toller,
of Kettering, delivered the charge&mdash;Mr. Edward Mial,
then of Leicester, the introductory discourse; and Mr.
Mursell, of the same place, preached to the people.</p>

<p>Though the Church and congregation could not
be considered in a happy, prosperous state, when this
settlement took place, yet they gradually attained to a
condition of peace and prosperity to which they had
for some years been strangers.</p>

<p>In the ninth year of Mr. Toller's ministry the present
Chapel was built, to which we have referred at
the commencement of this account. On the day of
opening, large assemblies were collected together, and
a noble spirit of liberality was manifested. Dr. Reed,
of London, preached in the morning, from Num. x. 29;
Dr. Leifchild, in the evening, from Rom. v. 9. Mr.
Alexander, of Norwich, preached on the next Sabbath.
The whole amount collected at these opening services
was 199. 1s., and donations were presented of sufficient
amount at once to set the Chapel entirely free
from debt. All this made it a season of gladness and
of lively interest to the people.</p>

<p>Since this effort they have gone forward with renewed
vigour and united energy. The number of
members added to the Church during the present pastorate
is 179. The present number of communicants
is 163. The general Sabbath-school connected with
the place contains 150 children. In the Infant-school,
conducted on the Sabbath, there are 80 children. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the use of the latter, a room has been recently erected
over the general school-room, with class-rooms for
the elder children, at a cost of 230, the whole of
which has been paid. Occasionally services are conducted,
chiefly on Sabbath evenings, by several members
of the Church, in five villages in the vicinity of
Harborough.</p>

<p>The whole aspect of things in this Christian society
now presents a happy illustration of the sentiment,
that a united people, under a faithful pastor, will go
on and prosper.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>MEMORIALS OF THE INDEPENDENT CHURCH AT
ASHLEY AND WILBARSTON.</h3>


<p>It might appear to be difficult to some of the Nonconformists
of the present day to decide, why their
forefathers should fix on this village as a place where
they should carry on the stated ministrations of the
Gospel, and form a Church on Congregational principles.
The population of the village is too small to
present a suitable sphere in itself for a Dissenting
congregation, while the Episcopal Church has the
patronage of the State and receives her emoluments.
It was probably regarded by those engaged in its
formation as presenting a central spot, where the
Nonconformists who resided in surrounding villages
might conveniently assemble. Hence, during its early
history the hearers travelled from a number of places
in the vicinity. One of the stated hearers, who died
at an advanced age a few years ago, and who had
been connected with the place from his earliest days,
informed the writer that he remembered hearers coming
from thirteen villages to attend under the ministry
of the Gospel at Ashley. Since that period Chapels
have been erected in several of those villages, in which
stated services are conducted; and this, as a matter of
course, diminishes the number of travellers to the old
places.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>The history of the Independent Church at Ashley
is connected, during the first 60 or 70 years of its
existence, with that of Market Harborough. It was
formed under the labours of the same minister, about
the same time (1673), and continued under the charge
of the same pastors until some time after the death of
Mr. David Some. For the character and labours of
its first pastors (Mr. Matthew Clark and his son, succeeded
by Mr. Some, who had Doddridge as an assistant
for a time), the reader is referred to the preceding
memorials of the Church at Harborough. The record
of members of the Church, preserved in the handwriting
of Mr. Some, shows that Church-meetings
were held at Ashley, members admitted there, the
Lord's Supper administered; proving that it was regarded
as a distinct Christian society, under the
pastoral charge of the minister of the Church at
Harborough. After Doddridge came to reside at Harborough,
and became assistant to Mr. Some, he took
his turn in preaching at Ashley. Tradition says, that
on one occasion he baptized nine children at the house
of a respectable farmer at Weston, about a mile from
Ashley, whose family were long connected with the
place, and at whose house the minister frequently, in
those days, dined on the Sabbath. From Doddridge's
own pen we learn that some of his published sermons
to young people were preached at Ashley, for he dedicates
them to the young people in the congregations
at Northampton, Harborough, Kibworth, Hinchley, and
Ashley, as the places where they had been preached.
The following note is appended to the sermon entitled
'The Orphan's Hope,' from Psalm xxvii. 10:
"When my father and mother forsake me, then the
Lord will take me up":&mdash;"This sermon was preached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
at Ashley, in Northamptonshire, March 6th, 1725, to
some young persons whose father, mother, and sister
had all died of the small-pox a few days before." In
the introduction to the discourse he observes&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>There are few precepts of the Gospel which will appear
more easy to a humane and generous mind than those in
which we are required to weep with them that weep; and
surely there are few circumstances of private life which will
more readily command our mournful sympathy than those of
that afflicted family, to the poor remains of which you will
naturally, on the first hearing of these words, direct your
thoughts, and perhaps your eyes too&mdash;the circumstances of
a family which God hath broken with breach upon breach&mdash;of
those distressed children whose father and mother have
forsaken them almost at once, and who have since been
visited with another stroke, which if alone had been very
grievous, and when added to such a weight of former sorrows
is, I fear, almost insupportable. I believe all of you who are
acquainted with the case sincerely pity them, and wish their
relief; but I am under some peculiar obligations to desire
and attempt it, not only on account of my public character,
but as I know the heart of an orphan, having myself been
deprived of both my parents at an age at which it might
reasonably be supposed a child should be most sensible of
such a loss. I cannot recollect any Scripture which was then
more comfortable, as I think none could have been more
suitable, to me, than that which is now before us.</p></blockquote>

<p>He touchingly and beautifully addresses the orphan
family towards the close of the discourse.</p>

<p>It must have been eight or ten years after the death
of Mr. Some, which took place in 1737, before the
Church at Ashley had a pastor placed over it separate
from the Church at Harborough, for the first pastor
here appears to have been a Mr. John West, who
had been a student at Northampton in Doddridge's
academy; for though we have no account preserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
of the period when he commenced or when he closed
his ministry, yet we find that he entered the academy
at Northampton in the year 1740. If immediately on
the close of his studies he became the pastor of the
Church at Ashley, according to the usual term this
would not take place until 1745 or 1746; and as we
find another pastor chosen within eleven or twelve
years from this time, and have no further account of
Mr. West, it is probable that he closed his life and
his ministry at a comparatively early age.</p>

<p>In the year 1757, Mr. Samuel Bacon was chosen
pastor of the Church at Ashley, in which office he
continued for 32 years. The residence of Mr. Bacon's
family was Sutton-in-Ashfield; he studied for the ministry
at the academy at Mile End, when Dr. Conder
and Mr., afterward Dr., Gibbons were the tutors.</p>

<p>It is supposed that Ashley was Mr. Bacon's only
charge; during his ministry here his residence was at
Wilbarston. No particulars have been preserved of
his character or ministry, the success of his labours,
or the state of the Church while he was pastor. He
appears to have been highly esteemed, and was spoken
of by his friends as one of the most lovely, amiable
men they ever knew. Mr. Bacon was one of the first
trustees for the Meeting House at Weldon and the
property connected with it, and one of the monthly
lecturers there for a number of years, frequently conducting
also the extra service they obtained on a
Sabbath evening in addition to the monthly lecture.
At Corby also Mr. Bacon had some engagements of a
similar nature. We find his name inserted in the
account of the ordination of Mr. J. Fuller, at Kettering,
in 1772. He died rather suddenly, February 6th,
1789, and was buried in the Meeting House, beneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the pulpit, where Mrs. Bacon was also interred, and
Mrs. Talbot, one of his three daughters.</p>

<p>In the same year that Mr. Bacon died, Mr. George
Bullock was invited to become the pastor, and entered
on his stated ministry; residing, like his predecessor,
at Wilbarston. He was a student at Mile End when
Dr. Addington was tutor, and we have heard that he
was a favourite student of the Doctor's; one memorial
of this we have seen. There is in the hands of a
daughter of Mr. Bullock a neat pocket Bible, in two
volumes, published in 1640, that evidently was used
by Dr. Addington when he preached in the villages
in the vicinity of Market Harborough, having on the
fly-leaves the texts of the sermons noted down very
neatly, with the places where they were preached, and
the time of the service; also four hymns selected from
the Olney Hymns by Newton and Cowper, suitable to
sing at the services, written in shorthand, according
to the system of Jeremiah Rich, improved by Doddridge.
This Bible was given by his tutor to Mr.
Bullock, as the following memorandum, written in
each volume by Mr. Bullock, testifies:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><div class="center"><span class="smcap">George Bullock.</span></div>

<p>The gift of my very dear, highly honoured,
much esteemed friend and tutor, the Rev. S.
Addington, D.D., No 5, Grove House, Mile
End, London, November 6th, 1788.</p></blockquote>

<p>About four years after Mr. Bullock commenced his
ministry at Ashley, a building was purchased and
fitted up at Wilbarston for a Meeting House. Occasional
services in a licensed room had for some time
been held; and the attendance increasing, it was thought
desirable to have a larger place and more regular services.
This Meeting House was opened in the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
1793, and from that time it was connected with Ashley,
to have one service by the pastor every Sabbath morning
or afternoon alternately, and occasionally a Sabbath
evening lecture; so that he became the minister of both
congregations, regularly travelling from one place to
the other to conduct these services.</p>

<p>In the early part of Mr. Bullock's ministry at Ashley
there was some considerable increase in the congregation
and the Church; but this did not continue
to the close of his course. After labouring for about
twenty years, in the month of January, 1809, he was
seized with a paralytic affection, which laid him aside
entirely from all public service. He resigned his charge,
seeing no prospect of restoration, in March, 1810; and
in the year 1811 he died, at the age of 48 years, and
was interred in the Meeting House at Wilbarston,
where a tablet is erected to his memory.</p>

<p>After this Mr. William Notcutt was invited to the
pastoral office, and was ordained June 6th, 1811.</p>

<p>Mr. Notcutt preached at both places in the manner
of his predecessor, and during some part of his ministry
took monthly services at Slawston and Hallaton; but
now there is a stated pastor, who preaches regularly at
both these places. During the ministry of Mr. Notcutt
a vestry was added to the Meeting House at Wilbarston
for week-evening services and for the Sabbath-school.
In the year 1820 the Meeting House was
enlarged, at an expense of about 200. The ministry
of Mr. Notcutt continued here about 15 years, and in
that time about 50 members were added to the Church.
In March, 1826, he resigned his charge, and removed
to Ipswich, where he is still labouring as pastor of the
Independent Church in Tacket Street.</p>

<p>After this removal, there was an unsettled interval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of about five years. For a short time the two congregations
separated, and tried to have a minister for
each, when a Mr. Bromiley was at Ashley and Mr.
Hill at Wilbarston. While Mr. Bromiley was at Ashley
the Meeting House underwent some alterations&mdash;was
new pewed, and the inside considerably improved;
but it still remains, as to the appearance of the
building, in the state of one of the oldest Nonconformist
village Meeting Houses, with its thatched
roof without, and its uncovered beams within; and it
may stand for years to come as a venerable relic of the
olden times. The first trust deed of the present Meeting
House is dated 1706.</p>

<p>After a short trial of separation, it was thought to
be best to re-unite the two places; and in the year
1831 the present minister, Mr. Thomas Coleman, who
had previously been pastor of the Independent Church
at Wollaston, was unanimously invited to take the
charge of both congregations, and he has conducted
the services at both places for 21 years.</p>

<p>At this time it was thought desirable that the residence
of the minister should be at Ashley, as most in
the centre of the connexion; a dwelling-house was
therefore prepared, adjoining the Meeting House, as
the residence of the minister for the time being;
ground was purchased for the building, a garden, and
a small burying place behind the Meeting. The alteration
of the Meeting, the purchase of the ground, the
building, &amp;c., must have cost more than 400, which
has been entirely paid off. There are about 17 acres
of land that have been purchased with moneys left to
the interest by different persons, which are put in trust
for the benefit of the minister for the time being.
There are now standing, as members of the Church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
about 56 persons; the Sabbath-schools contain about
60 children. There are occasional services conducted
in three villages in the vicinity, where there are rooms
licensed for public worship.</p>

<p>If we took pleasure in dwelling on opposition encountered,
we could record instances which would
reflect dishonour on the opposers, while in the result
the goodness of God and the power of the Gospel
were manifested. Nor might it be thought unsuitable
to place amidst these 'Memorials' a statement of the
following facts, while names are concealed:&mdash;That
a new rector, appointed to one of these villages,
seemed determined to distinguish himself by opposing
the occasional services that had been held in a
licensed house for twenty years. He summoned his
parishioners to meet in the Church; told them his design
to put a stop to the preaching in the house;
announced it as a very improper thing to have preaching
in a house, and in a room where people lived; and
when reminded of the Saviour's promise, that "<i>wherever</i>
two or three are gathered together in his name," replied,
"Ah, that might be all very true in those days, when
there were no churches built nor clergymen appointed;
but it did not apply now." Having gained the great
man of the village on his side, nothing would do but
they must have a notice drawn up and served on the
occupiers of the cottage where the service was held,
that they must leave it, if they did not give up the
preaching; and this was persisted in; though a noble
Earl who had property in the village, to whom the pastor
sent a statement of the case, expressed his decided wish
that the service should be continued in its usual course,&mdash;and
when after considerable effort another room, more
commodious, was obtained, gave a handsome donation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
towards fitting it up for the service, and expressed his
fervent wish that the Lord would give his gracious
blessing to the services that might be held there. In
the varied circumstances connected with this case,
there was a striking display&mdash;on the one side of the
narrowness and oppression engendered by the spirit of
bigotry, and on the other of the liberality and kindness
of enlightened Christianity. A few years have passed
since then, and the occasional services are still continued.</p>

<p>A voluntary Christian society, situated like this at
Ashley, in the course of such a long period, having
now existed for 175 years, must have undergone many
changes. The erection of new places of worship in localities
where its hearers and members in the early period
of its history used to reside, has at length confined its
connexions to four or five villages in its immediate
vicinity, and they are of small population, and several
of the old Dissenting families have been removed from
them. Being simply an agricultural district, without
trade or manufactures, there is no prospect of much
increase. As young persons rise into life they remove
to other places for employment, and some of the most
active and useful have been thus lost to the place that
gave them birth: but still a small Church remains to
bear its testimony to the great principles of the Gospel,
and to the truth and faithfulness of God; and it may
yet extend and prosper, by united believing prayer
and earnest effort, under the blessing of the great God
of Zion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>MEMORIALS OF THE INDEPENDENT CHURCH AT
WELFORD.</h3>


<p>In the extra-parochial district of Sulby, about a mile
from the village of Welford, was founded in the twelfth
century a monastery for a certain order of monks. It
was handsomely endowed, and dedicated to the Virgin
Mary. The site is now occupied by farm buildings.
But as another illustration of the changes which occur
in this mutable world, there resided, 180 years ago, in
some part of that abbey, a man who would not conform
to the dictates of his fellow men in the things of God&mdash;"a
man of worth, a man of letters too;" one eminent for
learning, talent, piety, usefulness; who laid the foundation
of two Dissenting interests in the county of Northampton,
and kept a Dissenting academy at Sulby, or
a seminary for the education of young men, several of
whom became eminent Dissenting ministers. This
person was the Rev. John Shuttlewood, A.B. He
was born at Wymeswold, in the county of Leicester,
January 3rd, 1632, of respectable parents, who sent
him to the Grammar-school at Leicester, and afterwards
to Christ's College, Cambridge, where he obtained the
degree of A.B. He was ordained to the ministry in
1654, not by episcopal ordination it would appear, but
in the method more generally adopted in the days of
the Commonwealth, in the congregation of Raunston,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
with an honourable testimonial from the classical presbytery
of Wirksworth, in the province of Derby.</p>

<p>The deep humility, piety, and devotedness of his
spirit were manifest by a solemn dedication of himself
to God, drawn up about this time in Latin, of which the
following is a translation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>O my God, on account of my sins thou hast afflicted me
with thy judgments! Thou art just, O Lord! in all thy dispensations
towards me, because I have grievously offended
against thee. I have followed the world; I have too much
indulged the flesh; and I have been very often overcome
by Satan. To thee I give up myself, to live to thee. And
now, before God, the searcher of hearts, I promise and engage
to leave my worldly concerns to the companion of my
life; to renounce the flesh with its affections; and to study
the good of the souls which thou art committing to my care.
Now, O Lord! do thou so strengthen and fortify me by the
Spirit of grace against all these my enemies, that I may obtain
the victory over them. And that I may seriously perform
these my good resolutions, let this paper, signed by my name,
be a witness against me, if I lie before thee.</p>

<div class="signature">
<span class="smcap">John Shuttlewood.</span><br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>A man of such a spirit we should expect to find
among those who refused to conform to the terms prescribed
to the ministers of the Church, soon after the
restoration of the second Charles. On this account
he was ejected from the living of Raunston and Hoose,
and afterward exposed to great suffering for his Nonconformity,
and his attempts to conduct the worship of
God and preach his word in a way his conscience approved.
In the year 1668, when he was uniting with
some others in singing a Psalm, one Mr. B., with thirty
or forty horsemen, with swords drawn and pistols
loaded, came and seized him with many that were worshipping
with him. Several of both sexes were beaten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and driven into the field, and there dismissed upon
promising to appear the next day before a justice of the
peace. Mr. Shuttlewood was conveyed to Leicester
Gaol, where he was a prisoner for some months. After
the "Conventicle Act" passed, he was again seized by
one Charles Gibbons, a notorious persecutor and profane
swearer&mdash;taken by him from one justice of the
peace to another; and warrants were issued to distrain
upon him for 20, upon the owner of the house where
he preached for 20, and 5<i>s.</i> apiece on others.</p>

<p>In 1674 Mr. Shuttlewood was living at Lubenham,
a village about two miles from Market Harborough.
There his house was entered when he was conducting
divine service; a warrant was obtained to distrain
upon him for 40, when seven of his milch cows were
taken and sold.</p>

<p>A short letter is preserved which was written to his
wife from Leicester gaol, which shows the exemplary
resignation, meekness, and faith with which he passed
through his trials. It was written February 20th, 1668.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">My dear Wife</span>,&mdash;Myself and fellow prisoners are in good
health. I bless God, I am very well satisfied with his dispensations
towards me in reference to my landlady's proceedings;
so that I am no longer disquieted with them, nor
solicitous about them, but patiently wait God's gracious disposal
of me. Perhaps infinite wisdom foresees some inconveniency
which we are not aware of, and therefore is about to
remove us. I am loath to leave the society of my dear brethren,
Mr. Clarke and Mr. Southal; but I hope in the end God will
so dispose of us, that we shall have cause to say, it is best for
us to be where God shall carry us. I know not which way to
look; but our "God is a very present help in a time of trouble,"
and will let us see that it is not our forecast, but his providence,
which shall provide an habitation for us. Let us rather
beg an improvement than a removal of his dispensations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Remember me to my father, children, &amp;c. Thus, in haste, I
remain, &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Mr. Clarke, mentioned in this letter, we suppose
to have been Matthew Clarke, the first pastor
of the Independent Church at Harborough and Ashley,
as he was cast three times into the same prison, and
was connected with Mr. Shuttlewood in sufferings, and
also in services and enjoyments.</p>

<p>He was obliged frequently to change his abode&mdash;sometimes
in Leicestershire, sometimes in Northamptonshire,
to escape from his foes; acting on the directions
given by his Lord, "If they persecute you in one city,
flee unto another." After a time he went to reside at
Sulby, a place remarkable for its picturesque and secluded
situation. The family of the Paynes, at Sulby
Hall, then favoured the Nonconformists. Here he
appears sometimes to have had a flourishing seminary.
A memorandum of his in a pocket almanack states
"that six students were added to his academy in one
year." The following persons, amongst others, studied
under him, and rose to eminence: Mr. Julius Saunders,
afterwards minister at Bedworth; Mr. John
Sheffield; Mr. Matthew Clarke, son, we suppose, of
Mr. Clarke of Harborough, afterwards minister in
London; Dr. Joseph Oldfield; Mr. Wilson, the father
of Mr. Samuel Wilson, of London; and Mr. Thomas
Emlyn. In the memoirs of the last of these it is
said, "that his parents chose to bring up their son to
the ministry among the Nonconformists; and that for
this purpose he was sent, in the year 1678, for academical
education to Mr. Shuttle<i>worth</i> (should have been
Shuttle<i>wood</i>), at Sulby, near Welford, in Northamptonshire."
Here he stayed four years. In the year 1679
he took a journey to Cambridge, and was admitted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Emanuel College, but returned again to Mr. Shuttlewood.
These circumstances indicate that Mr. Shuttlewood resided
at Sulby a considerable time. It was during this
period that he gathered a congregation at Welford and
at Creaton. But such was the spirit of the times,
and such the dangers to which the Nonconformists
were exposed, that at Welford, in the year 1674, they
met in a secluded part of the town, on the premises of
Mr. Edmund Miles, where they fitted up a place of
worship, which was the first Dissenting Meeting House
there; but such were the activity and zeal of their
enemies, that they thought it prudent to vary their
places of meeting, and to set a guard against the inroads
of their foes. They might have adopted the
language of Nehemiah as their own: "We made our
prayer unto our God, and set a watch day and night because
of them." There was a house occupied by Mr.
Charles Hanscomb, secluded in a narrow yard from the
main street, and open to a field in the direction of Mr.
Shuttlewood's house. Here the persecuted minister
and his people often met, one of the number being appointed
to watch, while the rest were engaged in worship;
so that when the informers were seen to approach
notice might be given to Mr. Shuttlewood and his
hearers, who escaped by the window into the fields.
Sometimes they met in the pastures which surrounded
the house at Sulby, amidst the darkness and the damps
of night. These were days of trial, when the reality
of religious principle was tested and its power appeared.</p>

<p>Mr. Shuttlewood was blest with a robust, vigorous
constitution, yet was of a very tender spirit; and the
death of one of his children so deeply pierced him as to
bring on many bodily complaints, which he carried with
him to his grave. His constitution was greatly injured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
by the sufferings he endured, and also by his preaching
at unseasonable hours, and in unsuitable places; so
that his health at length rapidly declined, and he died
when on a visit to the Church at Creaton, March 17th,
1688, in the 58th year of his age. A humble stone
was erected to his memory in the Churchyard, with this
brief but honourable inscription:&mdash;"Multum dilectus,
multum deflendus"&mdash;"Much beloved, much lamented".</p>

<p>Now the flock at Welford were as sheep without a
shepherd. They had not been formed into a regular
Christian Church under the ministry of Mr. Shuttlewood;
and for about ten years they were destitute of
a pastor, or any stated ministrations of divine truth
amongst them. Some of them, during this period, travelled
as far as Bedworth, in Warwickshire, upwards of
twenty miles, to hear Mr. Julius Saunders. Such was
the love these servants of Christ had for the Gospel,
that in the dark mornings of the winter season they travelled
by the light of a lantern as far as Lutterworth,
where they left it till their return in the evening, when
it was again lighted to conduct them home. It appears
that there were many in those days that would travel
as far as their feet would carry them, rather than be
entirely deprived of the ministry of the Gospel.</p>

<p>Some extracts from the records of the Church at Bedworth,
kindly sent to the writer by the present pastor of
the Church, show that there were, in the year 1687,
five persons from Welford added to that Church. This
was the second year in the history of that Church;
and at the close of it the pastor wrote, "thus has
God increased us and doubled our numbers, and many
of them stars of the first magnitude." William Powers,
from Welford, who joined the Church at Bedworth,
appears to have been a man of eminent piety. On one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
occasion Mr. Saunders writes, "It was while brother
Powers was earnestly praying the Lord to thrust forth
labourers into his harvest, that I was set at liberty
from the bond that was on my spirit." In 1688, a
female servant in one of the Welford families attending
at Bedworth was added to the Church. In the fourth
month of that year a Church-meeting is held at Welford,
when several persons from Elkington and Cottesbrook
are added to the Church. In the last month of this
year we find two more from Welford joined to the
Church at Bedworth; but the pastor records, that in
the third month of the next year "there was great dissatisfaction
expressed at a Church-meeting, on account
of my going to Welford and preaching there the last
Lord's-day, where there seems to be a mighty work of
God upon the hearts of many carrying on."</p>

<p>Mr. Saunders wished to devote one Sabbath in the
month to the people that met at Welford; but this
was strongly opposed by some of the Church at Bedworth,
who probably desired to have the pastor always
with them on the Sabbath.</p>

<p>One Valentine Drake showed great opposition to the
pastor going to preach at Welford; "but the Church,"
adds Mr. Saunders, "gave me liberty; they declared
that it was meet that, as a ruling elder, I should appoint
my own meetings to preach." "The trouble was
great that I met with, all about going to Welford one
Lord's-day in the month." The opponents ultimately
prevailed, so that the minister was obliged to give up
the services there. "In the 9th month, 1689, a solemn
assembly of the Church. The Church refused to cast
out Valentine Drake for all that he had done; and he
had done much evil. He drew many after him; made
a schism in the Church; manifested fiery passions in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Church-meetings; and so far prevailed, that I was
necessitated to break off from going to Welford, whereby
that great and blessed work that was going on was
made to cease. Many that had a hand in breaking it
never flourished in their souls after. In those days
my hands were weak."</p>

<p>"In 1691, brother William Powers, from Welford, was
chosen to be a ruling elder. On the twelfth day of the
twelfth month, at Welford, the brethren being assembled
together&mdash;Mr. Davis, brother Tebbirt, and brother Taylor,
from Rowell&mdash;I gave brother Powers a charge to
fulfil his office; he declared his willing mind to do so,
and that he did accept of the office." "Elizabeth Ridgly,
of Haslebeech, Northamptonshire, joined this Church,
1687. She was a diligent saint, who came to our
Church-meetings seventeen long miles, twelve times in
a year, and that on foot." It is supposed the distance
was not far short of twenty-seven miles.</p>

<p>Some of the Welford hearers attended at Kettering
and at Harborough until the year 1698, when the Rev.
John Norris came to Welford. He had been educated
to Sheriffhales, in Shropshire. When Mr. Norris came
to Welford, the days of liberty and peace had so far
dawned upon the Nonconformists that they could no
longer be persecuted according to law; and his ministry
proving very acceptable to the people, a new Meeting
House was built capable of seating 500 hearers,
which was opened in the year 1700; and in the same
year Mr. Norris formed them into a Christian Church.
The first time he administered the Lord's Supper, there
were twenty-six members united in celebrating the
Saviour's death; but after a few months the number
increased to sixty members. The ground on which
the Meeting House was built was given by the Paynes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
of Sulby Hall; and five of the members of this family
united with the twenty-six who first formed themselves
into a Church under Mr. Norris.</p>

<p>Mr. Norris was very popular as a preacher, much
beloved as a Christian minister, especially by his
brethren in the ministry. He was engaged at the
ordination of Doddridge, at Northampton, in asking
the questions, and offering the ordination prayer. Doddridge
regarded him with affection and veneration, as
a father. He died very suddenly, February 8, 1738,
in the sixty-third year of his age: he was buried in
the Churchyard. The following lines on his tombstone
were written by Doddridge:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">Decked with each manly and each Christian grace,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The friend of God, and all the human race&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">While earth and heaven beheld him with delight,</span><br />
<span class="i0">From earth to heaven he winged a sudden flight.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Lo! angels pressed to bear their charge above,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To kindred realms of piety and love.</span><br />
</div>

<p>Doddridge preached his funeral sermon, from Genesis
v. 24: "And Enoch walked with God, and he was
not, for God took him."</p>

<p>We present a few passages from this discourse,
descriptive of the character and ministry of Mr.
Norris.</p>

<blockquote><p>I may be permitted publicly to acknowledge (says Doddridge)
the sense I have of the favour of divine providence, in
leading me so early into the acquaintance of this excellent
person, and blessing me with so great a share of his friendship,
with which I was honoured from my first entrance into
the ministry, and which his singular humility and condescension,
wisdom and piety, have rendered exceedingly delightful
and improving to me in all the succeeding years of life.</p>

<p>And surely I should be greatly deficient in the duty of this
day, if I did not solemnly charge it upon you frequently to
recollect your obligations to the divine goodness in giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
you so able and so tender a shepherd, and in continuing him
amongst you for so long a time with such cordial love, that
repeated, unanimous, and earnest solicitations from the most
considerable congregations in the neighbouring counties
could not prevail upon him to remove from you. So evident
was it that "he took the oversight of you, not by constraint,
but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind."</p>

<p>It may eminently be said of you, my friends, in a spiritual
sense, that you have been "fed with the finest of the wheat,"
as the pure and uncorrupted truths of the Gospel have been
preached amongst you with plainness and seriousness, and in
the spirit of love. Your minds have not been amused with
useless subtilties and barren speculations; you have not been
vexed with strifes of words, unprofitable and vain; nor
grieved with passionate invectives against your brethren of
any denomination&mdash;invectives, which are never more criminal
than when delivered in the name of the Lord, and which
too often turn the food of souls into poison, and that which
should have been for their welfare, into a trap. This "good
man brought out of the good treasure of his heart good things";
his generous and benevolent soul overflowed with sentiments
of candour and love; and he was never more in his own element,
than when he was telling you that "the kingdom of
God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and
joy in the Holy Ghost": and I firmly believe, that in the
thirty-eight years of his ministry among you he never delivered
a sermon or a sentence inconsistent with that great
principle.</p>

<p>I join with you in lamenting that none of those elaborate
and judicious discourses which he delivered among you, from
Sabbath to Sabbath, are, or can be, published to the world: for
though it is certain that his graceful and venerable aspect,
and his easy yet lively manner, gave a peculiar beauty to
them as delivered by himself; yet, when I consider how judiciously
his thoughts were selected, how methodically they
were disposed, and with what propriety, elegance, and spirit
they were expressed, I am well assured they would generally
have been esteemed a rich addition to that great number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
practical writings with which our age and country is already
blest, and with which I hope it will still abound. * *
* * * * * And, for what he was in the
domestic relations of life, I had almost said, I wish it may
not be too long, but I will rather say too tenderly, remembered.
The loss of a husband so constantly obliging, so
affectionately sympathizing, so well furnished as a prudent
guide and a pleasant companion, and so well disposed for the
offices of both, will, I fear, be too deeply felt. May the sense
of it be tempered with those divine consolations which he
was so eminently fit to administer, but which have not surely
lost their value, and will not, I trust, lose their relish, though
no longer administered by him. May the children which were
dear to him as his own, never forget with how much diligence
he instructed them; with how much importunity and constancy
he prayed for them; and with what tenderness he
watched over all their interests.</p>

<p>I may add, even in the decline of life this light was growing
brighter and brighter; and though his removal, while his
capacities of usefulness were to the last so great, must be very
affecting to you, yet I cannot forbear saying that you have
some peculiar reason to be thankful for the manner and circumstances
of his death.</p>

<p>Nature was not racked with tormenting pains, nor worn
out by a tedious, consuming illness; but the good man grew
a little drowsy towards the evening of his long day, and, having
"served his generation according to the will of God,"
gently "fell asleep" as he was going from one apartment of
the house to another, and all the business and struggle of
dying was over in less time than could have served him to
get up the stairs, as he was attempting to do. It is a delightful
thought, that God dismissed his servant in so peaceful
a manner that his death so much resembled a translation,
and "he was not, for God took him."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Norris preached the last Sabbath he lived, and
concluded the public service with a copious, lively, and
affectionate prayer for his people, which could not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
been more suitable if he had known he was then taking
his last farewell.</p>

<p>After the death of Mr. Norris, Job Orton preached
his first sermon at Welford, and received an invitation
from the people to become their pastor; but this he
declined, as he did several other invitations, on account
of his engagements as assistant to Dr. Doddridge in
the academy.</p>

<p>Another of the Doctor's pupils, a Mr. Charles
Bulkley, was settled over the Church at Welford;
but early in the next year after his ordination he
changed his sentiments on the doctrines of the Gospel,
and on the ordinance of baptism; consequently, he
was requested by the Church to resign his office as
pastor over them, which he did, and retired to London,
where he joined the General Baptists.</p>

<p>At this juncture, Mr. Bottrill, a gentleman of considerable
property, connected with the Church at Welford,
was at Weldon, a village about eight miles from
Oundle; and there he happened to hear a young minister
preach, who was a native of Oundle, and was on
a visit to his widowed mother, who resided there. This
apparently incidental circumstance was the means of
bringing about a connexion that was long continued,
and of a very happy and useful character. This young
minister was Mr. King, son of a late pastor of the Independent
Church at Oundle.</p>

<p>When Mr. Bottrill returned home, he induced the
Church at Welford to invite Mr. King to preach to
them, which he did for two Sabbaths, much to their
satisfaction. After some further probation, he received
a unanimous invitation to become their pastor, which
he accepted, and was ordained in the spring of the
year 1743; the Rev. Mr. Hill, of London, and Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Doddridge, preached on the occasion. When Mr.
King became pastor, the number of members in the
Church was 87.</p>

<p>There are some interesting circumstances connected
with Mr. King's early history, worthy of notice. If he
was, like Samuel, early devoted to God, it was in connexion
with his mother having the spirit of Hannah in
pleading for him, and giving him up to God. His
father was the Rev. Joseph King, highly respected as
the Independent minister at Oundle. His mother,
Mrs. Hannah King, was a lady distinguished for her
piety and intelligence; and she earnestly desired to
have a son, that she might devote him to the service
of the sanctuary.</p>

<p>Her desire being granted in the birth of a son, she,
like Hannah, called his name Samuel, as a constant
memorial of her prayers and her purpose. She fondly
hoped to see him trained by paternal instruction for
the Christian ministry, when, by a mysterious providence,
with a sudden stroke she was bereft of her
beloved partner, in the midst of his usefulness and
in the vigour of his life, being but 46 years of age.
Still, amidst the sorrows, the trials, and difficulties of
widowhood, her boy not four years of age, and a
family dependent upon slender means for support, this
mother cherished her fond impression concerning this
son. At an early age he was placed in the Grammar-school
at Oundle, and made great proficiency; from
thence he was removed to the classical School for Dissenters
at Mount Sorrell, Leicestershire, then under
the direction of Mr. Thomas Watson and Mr. Abel
Ragg&mdash;the same Mr. Ragg who had been Doddridge's
fellow pupil and intimate friend, and who died in the
same year with his other beloved friend and fellow
pupil, Mr. David Some, junior.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>From his earliest days, Mrs. King endeavoured to
impress her son's mind with the important truths of
the Gospel; and the Lord blessed her efforts and
heard and answered her prayers, in the conversion of
her son. When he had left home his religious impressions
were deepened by the epistolary admonitions
of his mother, and by the religious instructions of his
tutors. When he removed from this school he lived
for a time with an uncle at Long Thorpe, who was an
extensive farmer, and steward to Sir Francis St. John,
who lived there. In this situation he improved the
leisure afforded by agriculture in a diligent attention
to mental and devout exercises. Thus occupied, he
came to a settled determination to enter the ministry;
which purpose, after due consideration, he disclosed to
his mother. This was joyful intelligence to her; and
she lost no time in communicating it to a friend and
patron, Mrs. Cooke, of Newington, a lady greatly
esteemed for her piety and liberality. With characteristic
promptitude and kindness, she immediately
engaged to support him while prosecuting his studies
at the academy. He was placed under the tuition of
Dr. Abraham Taylor, at Deptford, in 1735; he continued
there till 1740, when the institution was removed
to Stepney.</p>

<p>Mr. King attended the ministry of Mr. Thomas
Bradbury, at New Court, with whose Church he became
connected.</p>

<p>While he was at Deptford, a party of the students
went one evening to bathe, when Mr., afterwards Dr.
Thomas Gibbons, going beyond his depth, was in
danger of drowning. No one present could swim
except Mr. King, who at the moment was standing
at the water side at a short distance. On hearing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
cries of the other students he hurried to the spot,
plunged into the water, caught Mr. Gibbons by the
hair when in the act of sinking, and thus rescued him
from a watery grave, as animation was suspended, and
was with considerable difficulty restored. Dr. Gibbons
ever after retained a most affectionate attachment to
Mr. King, and after he was settled at Welford paid
him several visits and preached for him, and always
recurred to this providential deliverance with grateful
recollections.</p>

<p>The congregation at Welford, when Mr. King became
its pastor, was considered to be large and respectable,
hearers attending on the Sabbath from fourteen
villages around. In connexion with this circumstance
it may be mentioned, that in some of those villages
there are now stated congregations, either of the
Independent or Baptist denomination, with pastors
placed over them, while the congregation at Welford
is as large as ever; which shows a considerable increase
in the number of Dissenters in those parts in
the course of the last century. Mr. King was very
diligent and laborious in the work to which he had
become devoted, preaching several nights in the week
in the villages around, beside the constant services of
the Sabbath. His ministry was rendered eminently
useful, so that the Church doubled its numbers in the
early years of his pastorate.</p>

<p>He married Miss Elizabeth Norris, the only child
of his predecessor, by whom he had a family of ten
children. It was a circumstance not honourable to
his people, considering their numbers and the wealth
of some individuals among them, that Mr. King had
to struggle with pecuniary difficulties, which almost
led to his removal from them. A pressing invitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
was sent to him from the congregation at Castle Gate,
Nottingham, to be co-pastor with the venerable James
Ross, M.A., with an offer of more than double the
salary that he was receiving at Welford. The difficulties
attending him here, with his numerous family,
inclined him to attend to this call; but when it became
known to his people, they waited upon him, expressed
their great regret that he should think of leaving
them, their firm attachment to him, reminded him of
the providential way in which he was brought amongst
them, and referred to the happy effects of his labours;
which, after some deliberation, prevailed, so that he
determined to continue with them and to maintain
the struggle with the difficulties that attended him.
But the providence of God at length appeared for
him. A Miss Cooke, an aged maiden lady, the only
survivor of a wealthy family, bequeathed to him some
property, which, with some other legacies he received,
enabled him to give his children a liberal education,
and to place his sons in respectable situations; and
also, in some degree, to gratify his benevolent feelings
in the exercise of liberality to those who were in
distress.</p>

<p>During the ministry of Mr. King, Mr. John Wood,
a native of Welford, became a member of the Church,
and was called to the work of the ministry. He passed
with great credit through his academical course at
Daventry, and became first minister at Sudbury, in
Suffolk, and afterwards at Creaton, in Northamptonshire,
where, after twenty years' labour, he died. The
young people of Mr. King's flock engaged a large
portion of his solicitude; his public and private instructions
were eminently blessed to many of them.</p>

<p>It was a great gratification to this excellent minister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
to be able to sustain his aged mother in the decline of
her days&mdash;to promote her comfort by receiving her into
his house, where she died, in 1763, at the advanced
age of 81 years. With what delight would such a
mother behold the answer to her prayers in the devoted
labours and usefulness of this son, whom she
had asked of the Lord, and consecrated to him; and
with what peculiar interest must such a son look on
that aged mother as she was ripening for heaven, to
whom, under God, he owed all that he had attained!</p>

<p>He lost his beloved partner, who was of great value
in such a sphere, after a lingering illness, in the 60th
year of her age. When his own infirmities increased
and strength failed, so as to render him incapable of
fulfilling the duties of his office, after about 40 years'
labour amongst them he resigned his charge in 1782,
and went to reside at the house of the Rev. James
Horsey, of Northampton, who had married one of his
daughters. There, enjoying the affectionate attentions
of his daughter, he peacefully ended his days,
November 6th, 1788, in the 74th year of his age.
His remains were conveyed to Welford for interment;
a funeral sermon was preached by his son-in-law, Mr.
Horsey, to a crowded audience, from words chosen by
the deceased (Jude, verse 21): "Looking for the mercy
of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life." The
sermon was printed at the request of the Church and
congregation. Mr. Horsey observes&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>About forty years ago God placed his servant in this part of
his vineyard, and enabled him to labour, both in season and
out of season, to defend his cause in this town and neighbourhood.
That his talents were generally acceptable, most
who hear me know. The plainness of his style (for he always
aimed to be understood by the lowest of his hearers), the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
evangelical complexion of his doctrine, and the seriousness of
his address, endeared him peculiarly to other congregations
as well as his own; and numbers in this and in neighbouring
counties ascribe to his instrumentality their first serious
thoughts of God and eternity. With many present he has
laboured even from your infancy, endeavouring, by an attention
to catechising, suggesting the most simple and easy remarks,
to bring you to an early acquaintance with the holy
Scriptures. And no greater pleasure could he feel than to
see the children of his charge "walking in the truth." As
you have risen into life, he has regularly addressed you by his
annual instructions to the youth of the assembly, cautioning
against the paths of the destroyer, and directing your feet
in the way of peace. Oh, how often have I seen him, with
marks of inward reverence and undissembled piety, sit like
good old Simeon "waiting for the consolation of Israel"!
And when a word has been dropped, to bring his former
charge to his remembrance, with the tenderest tokens of
friendship, and the falling tears of affection, would he waft
up a prayer to heaven for your prosperity.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. King only published two sermons, one preached
to his own people on the murrain among the cattle,
and another delivered at the ordination of Mr. Joshua
Symonds, at Bedford, 1767.</p>

<p>After Mr. King's resignation there were three pastors,
each of whom continued for a very short time
over the people at Welford. Mr. William Severn
was ordained May 22nd, 1782. It is stated that he
was a very popular preacher, possessed of uncommon
talents; that his Sabbath evening and week-day lectures
were anticipated with great pleasure by his
hearers, who were strongly attached to him: but he
resigned his charge in less than two years, went to
Hinckley, in Leicestershire, and at length, we regret to
state, departed from the faith he once preached, and
died some years after in connexion with a Socinian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
congregation in Hull. A Mr. Northend was the next
who was invited to Welford; but the invitation was
far from unanimous, so that, though he accepted it,
his services continued for a very short time. In the
spring of 1789 Mr. Evan Johns was settled as their
pastor; but this gentleman, we are informed, much
injured his usefulness, and lessened the esteem of his
friends for him, by practising the absurd theory of
animal magnetism, which induced him to tender his
resignation, and he left, in 1790, for Bury St. Edmund's.</p>

<p>In 1792, Mr. John Clement Bicknell, a student at
Newport Pagnell, was invited on probation; and in
February, 1793, he was ordained pastor. The following
ministers were engaged on that occasion, viz.:&mdash;
Messrs. Hillyard, of Bedford; Greathead, of Newport;
Grundy, of Lutterworth; Carver, of Wellingborough;
Summers, of Wellingborough; Gill, of Market Harborough;
Davis, of Wigston; Gardner, of Kilsby.</p>

<p>Soon after this settlement, the old Meeting House
being much out of repair, it was determined to erect
a new one in a more eligible part of the town, near
the residence of the pastor. This was opened for worship
in 1793; and a few years after, in 1799, a more
respectable house was built for the minister on the
site of the old one, which together cost the people
about 1500; and, to their honour, the whole was in
a short time discharged.</p>

<p>The Church appears to have decreased in number
during the changes that had taken place, as there are
only 41 names given as members when Mr. Bicknell
was settled. In the course of his ministry 56 members
were added. He filled the pastoral office at Welford
for about 18 years and 9 months, as he resigned his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
charge in 1811. In the latter years of his life Mr.
Bicknell was minister at Crick, where he died at an
advanced age, in the year 1849.</p>

<p>In October, 1812, Mr. Benjamin Hobson, of Driffield,
Yorkshire, visited Welford as a probationer, on
the recommendation of Mr. Gill, of Market Harborough.
After supplying four Sabbaths, he received
a unanimous invitation from the Church and congregation
to the pastoral office, which he accepted, and
entered on his stated labours February 21st, 1813.
The number of members in the Church at this time is
stated as 43.</p>

<p>Mr. Hobson was born at Sheffield, in the year 1780.
In the account given of his early life, we have another
case presented, amongst the thousands that have been
known in the Church of God and in the ministry of the
Gospel, of one who had to trace his early impressions
of religion to the efforts of a pious mother. From
early youth he was the "subject of pious emotions,"
which he always attributed with grateful and filial
affection to the piety and prayers of his mother. "Her
earnest importunity at family prayer for the salvation
of her children," he said, "often affected me, and I
believe was the means of leading me to see the value
of my soul and the necessity of dependence on Jesus
Christ." He derived benefit from some of the last
sermons of the Rev. Jehoiada Brewer, and at length
joined the Church under the care of Rev. James
Boden. He commenced his studies for the ministry
at Homerton; but during the first year his health was
so affected that he was obliged to return home. This
led to a change in the place where his studies were to
be pursued. At the urgent request of his mother, that
he might not be placed so far from home, in case sickness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
should return, he obtained admission into the
college at Rotherham in 1802, having for his tutors
Dr. Edward Williams and Mr. Maurice Phillips. He
pursued his studies with commendable diligence, and
obtained general esteem by his consistent piety. His
first pastoral charge was at Driffield, in Yorkshire,
where he was ordained on the 8th July, 1806. Here
his labours were useful and his ministry prized; but in
the year 1813, influenced in a great degree by the
advice of his friend and relative, Mr. G. Collison,
of Hackney, and Mr. G. Gill, of Market Harborough,
he removed to Welford: and here he continued until
within four months of the close of his life, serving
this people as their faithful and affectionate pastor for
about thirty-five years; and he did this with general
acceptance and prevailing usefulness. During his
ministry 115 members were added to the Church.
His devoted piety was always manifest. With an
earnest concern to promote the highest welfare of his
charge, with an ardent attachment to the cause of God,
with strong desire to advance the kingdom of the Redeemer,
and to be a blessing to those around him, he
steadfastly pursued his labours. He had much of the
spirit of devotion&mdash;was a man of prayer, a man of
God. His preaching was earnest and affectionate,
plain and faithful. He was the attentive village pastor,
that took some delight in visiting his flock. If
his talents were not of a high order, they were of a
useful character. If his mind was not powerful, his
spirit was affectionate and fervent, and his views of
evangelical truth clear and decided. If a sanguine
temperament rendered him at times too susceptible,
religious principle triumphed, and Christian prudence
prevailed. He had a large share of domestic happiness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
earnestly seeking the spiritual welfare of his
children, their early acquaintance with God, and decision
for the Saviour. He had the happiness of seeing
all of them, in the morning of life, "choosing the good
part which shall not be taken away from them."</p>

<p>He greatly loved the Missionary cause, and endeavoured
to promote a missionary spirit amongst his
people. He had one son. That son was engaged in
the medical profession, but he was at length anxious
to go as a medical missionary to China. The father's
love to the Missionary cause was now put to the test;
and its sincerity was fully proved. Though for a
time conflicting feelings agitated his mind, and parental
affection prompted him to say, "Anything but
<i>this</i>," yet in the strength of the Lord God he was
enabled to present this sacrifice with a willing mind,
and could but rejoice that he was counted worthy to be
so closely identified with the Missionary cause. He was
Secretary for about ten years to the Northamptonshire
Independent Association, and was generally held in
high esteem by his brethren. The last meeting of
this Association, before Mr. Hobson removed, was
held at Welford, when he resigned his office, and the
ministers present testified in a gratifying manner their
esteem and affection.</p>

<p>In the year 1847 his declining health rendered it
necessary that there should be some change in his
ministerial duties. An attempt was made to obtain an
assistant; but increasing indisposition, arising from
chronic bronchitis, together with some things appearing
which were painful to his feelings, decided him at
length to relinquish the work, and try the effect of a
change of air. He left Welford on the 18th of May,
1848, and numbers of his people felt and said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
not their faithful minister only, but their father and
their friend, they were about to lose.</p>

<p>He went to the island of Guernsey, with the hope
that a milder climate might benefit his health and
recruit his strength. But he continued to decline;
and just four months after bidding farewell to his
people at the sacramental table, he was called from the
scenes of time to join the Church triumphant above.</p>

<p>In the closing scene, looking at life in the light of
eternity, what he had been enabled to do in the service
of God seemed to be nothing in comparison with what
he had failed to accomplish. His feelings for some
weeks were not only checkered, but very painful. The
state of his mind was dark and distressing, arising, no
doubt, from physical weakness, and the completely
relaxed state of the nervous system. But the last
week was one of great mercy. The enemy was not
suffered to distress, nor fears to agitate: his mind was
kept "in perfect peace, being stayed on God." He
often spake of Christ as the <i>rock</i>. He died on the
evening of the Sabbath, September 3rd. His remains
are deposited in the new cemetery at Saint Peter's Port,
Guernsey. The event of his death was suitably improved
there by the Rev. W. Wild, from Phil. iii. 9;
and at Welford by his successor, from Hebrews xi. 4:
"He being dead, yet speaketh."</p>

<p>Mr. Hobson was succeeded in his labours at Welford
almost immediately by Mr. Walter Gill, who had pursued
his studies for the ministry at the seminary at
Hackney. He entered on his probationary services in
May, 1848, and was ordained in the month of April in
the following year. Mr. Ransom, Mr. Gill's classical
tutor, delivered the introductory discourse; Mr. Toller,
of Kettering, offered the ordination prayer; Mr. Toller,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of Harborough, asked the usual questions; Mr. Keynes,
of Blandford, delivered the charge; and Mr. James, of
Birmingham, preached to the people in the evening.</p>

<p>The present number of members in the Church is
about 80. There are 130 children in the Sabbath-schools
connected with the congregation, viz.&mdash;boys,
72; girls, 58: there are 23 teachers.</p>

<p>There are occasional services conducted on Sabbath
evenings in the village of South Kibworth, where
there is a small Chapel held in trust by some of the
Welford friends.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>MEMORIALS OF THE INDEPENDENT CHURCH AT
CREATON.</h3>


<p>In the accounts of the Nonconformist ministers who
in the year 1662 sacrificed their livings in the Established
Church, in obedience to what they regarded as
the claims of truth and of conscience, we find the name of
Mr. Richard Hook, ejected from the rectory of Creaton,
Northamptonshire. After his separation from the
Church he preached for some time in his own house;
but he afterwards removed from Creaton, and went to
reside at Northampton. Though we have no certain
information as to the results of Mr. Hook's ministry,
yet there is some reason to conclude that a number of
the people left the Church with their pastor, and
sought for spiritual instruction, as they had opportunity,
under the ministry of the Nonconformists. It was
probably after the removal of Mr. Hook from Creaton
that Mr. Shuttlewood, another of the Nonconformist
ministers, began to preach the Gospel in this place.
At that time his residence was at Sulby Abbey, near
Welford, and his labours appear to have been then divided
chiefly between Welford and Creaton. For a more
particular account of Mr. Shuttlewood, his labours and
his sufferings in the cause of God, we must refer the
reader to the memorials of the Church at Welford.
But it was when on a visit to his friends at Creaton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
that he was seized with an affliction that quickly terminated
his useful life, and raised his spirit to that "rest
that remaineth for the people of God." Here he ended
his days, and here his remains were interred in the
Churchyard, where a plain stone was erected to his
memory.</p>

<p>Mr. Ironmonger is said to have been the next Nonconformist
minister here, after Mr. Shuttlewood. In
an account of the ordination of Mr. Tingey, a predecessor
of Doddridge at Northampton, we find a Mr.
John Ironmonger, of Buckingham, engaged. We think
it probable that this was the person that for a time
ministered at Creaton. A Mr. Dale, minister at
Creaton, was present at the ordination of Mr. Tingey,
in 1709. The pastor immediately succeeding was Mr.
Barker; then Mr. Chambers is recorded as the next
minister here, and he died in 1735. After this came
Mr. Hextal, who was a native of Broughton, in Northamptonshire;
a member of the Church at Kettering;
for some time studied under Mr. Saunders, his pastor,
preparatory to his admittance into the academy at
Northampton under Dr. Doddridge, which he entered
in the year 1732.</p>

<p>On the completion of his studies, it is stated that he
settled at Creaton in 1736; but his ordination did not
take place until 1738, for there is still preserved in
the handwriting of Doddridge the testimonial that was
given on the day of ordination, of which the following
is a copy:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><div class="signature"><i>Creaton</i>, <i>April</i> 26, 1738.
</div>

<p>This is to certify, that the Rev. Mr. Wm. Hextal, having
given full satisfaction as to his abilities and qualifications for
the work of the ministry, was this day set apart to the pastoral
office by prayer, fasting, and the imposition of our hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
at the desire of the Church of Christ in this place, who unanimously
invited him to the exercise of the said office amongst
them.</p>

<p>Witness our hands&mdash;P. <span class="smcap">Doddridge</span>, D.D.; <span class="smcap">Jas. Watson</span>,
Leicester; <span class="smcap">Thos. Cartwright</span>; J. <span class="smcap">Drake</span>, Yardley; J. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>,
Newport; <span class="smcap">Saml. Tailor</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>We find a list of members of the Church, containing
forty-seven names of persons that were communicants
at the time of Mr. Hextal's settlement; then follow
the names of twenty-one members, over which the
pastor has written, "Taken in since I came." These
members were resident in ten different villages.</p>

<p>In the handwriting of Mr. Hextal we find a copy
of the following recommendation. Though it is without
date or any full direction, yet it appears to have
been an application to the manager of some fund for
assistance.</p>

<blockquote><p>The congregation at Creaton, lately under the care of
Mr. Chambers, have unanimously made choice of Mr. Hextal
to succeed him, after finishing a regular course of academical
learning at Northampton acceptably, and where his
temper and conduct secured him very respectful regard from
the people. As his abilities, principles, and character are
very satisfactory to us, and, according to our view of things,
worthy of the esteem of others, we take the liberty to recommend
him to your favour and encouragement, as one that
promises usefulness, and we think, by the divine blessing,
may be instrumental in supporting the interests of Christianity
in that society. Your favourable view of this our
recommendation will lay an additional obligation on &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<div class="center"><i>To the Rev. the Ministers, and the other Gentlemen, Managers, &amp;c.</i></div></blockquote>

<p>It was a short time after the settlement of Mr. Hextal,
that a minister's meeting being held at Creaton,
Dr. Doddridge preached his interesting sermon, entitled
'Christian Candour and Unanimity stated, illustrated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
and urged,' from Phil. ii. 1, 2, which was afterwards
published, with a Dedication to the Countess of Huntingdon.
The ministry of Mr. Hextal at Creaton continued
until the year 1752, when he removed to Sudbury.</p>

<p>The next pastor was Mr. Warburton. For some
time he assisted Mr. Gilbert, the successor of Doddridge
at Northampton, and preached at Creaton in the
afternoon of the Sabbath. Mr. Gilbert dying in 1760,
Mr. Warburton confined his labours to Creaton, where
he was minister for about twenty years. After his
removal, Mr. John Wood, from Sudbury, was unanimously
chosen his successor the same year. Mr. Wood
was a native of Welford, sent out by the Church there,
during the ministry of Mr. King, to preach the Gospel:
he was educated at the academy at Daventry. He
laboured here for about twenty years, and closed his
life and his services in the Church on earth in this
place. He died April 7th, 1790, "leaving the Church,"
it is observed, "in a declining state."</p>

<p>The next pastor was Mr. Joseph Whitehead, who
came to Creaton in 1793, and continued his labours
here for twenty-three years. When Mr. Whitehead
entered on his ministry here there were twenty-two
members of the Church, and seventy-one were added
during the years of his pastorate. In the second year
of Mr. Whitehead's labours the present Meeting House
was erected. The old building, which held about 400
persons, was occupied on a lease of ninety-nine years,
supposed to have commenced about the date of 1694,
as it was at the expiration of that lease that the new
place of worship was reared.</p>

<p>The fidelity and zeal with which Mr. Whitehead
discharged his ministerial office was crowned with such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
success as greatly to increase the Church and congregation.
The medical assistance which he was always
ready to afford to those who needed it, rendered him
extensively useful to the afflicted poor in his neighbourhood.
His candid and friendly disposition endeared
him to his brethren in the ministry. His exemplary
patience, under painful bodily affliction, displayed the
excellence of his Christian principles. As he advanced
in life, he evidently appeared to grow in grace; acting
habitually under the eye of his Master, he was prepared
for his change. "Blessed is that servant whom his
Lord when he cometh shall find so doing." He died
at the house of his friend, the Rev. H. Knight, of
Yelvertoft, after a few hours' illness. His remains
were interred, with every token of respect, at the foot
of the pulpit where he so often urged upon his people
the great doctrines and precepts of the Gospel. Six
of his brethren bore the pall. The Rev. Mr. Jones,
minister of the parish Church, attended, as a token
of his high esteem for the deceased. The Rev. G.
Gill, of Harborough, began the funeral service with
prayer; the Rev. B. L. Edwards, of Northampton,
delivered a very affecting and appropriate address; the
Rev. J. Gronow, of Weedon, concluded the solemn
service. A large congregation of people assembled on
the occasion, whose undissembled grief showed how
much he was beloved. On the following Lord's-day
the Rev. H. Knight, in whose house he died, improved
the affecting providence, from Heb. xiii. 7-9. The
place of worship was thronged before the service
commenced, and many hundreds could not gain admittance.</p>

<p>Mr. T. Aston succeeded Mr. Whitehead. He had
pursued his studies for the ministry at Hackney, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
was ordained over this Church and congregation
September 23rd, 1817. On that occasion Mr. Hobson,
of Welford, commenced the service with reading and
prayer; Mr. Gill, of Harborough, stated the nature of
a Gospel Church; Mr. Knight, of Yelvertoft, offered
the ordination prayer; Mr. D. W. Aston, of Buckingham,
brother to the ordained minister, delivered the
charge, from Col. iv. 17; Mr. Toller, of Kettering,
preached from Luke x. 11; Mr. Griffiths, of Long
Buckby, concluded.</p>

<p>Mr. Aston admitted thirty-two members to the Church
during his ministry, which continued until about the
year 1826, when Mr. Williams became the pastor of
the Church, who gives the following account of his
ordination to that office:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Having received a unanimous invitation from the Church
and congregation at Creaton to become their pastor, I was
ordained October 7th, 1828. Mr. Edwards, of Northampton,
delivered the introductory discourse; Mr. Griffiths, of Long
Buckby, offered the ordination prayer; Mr. Scott, of Rowell,
gave the charge; and Mr. Hobson, of Welford, preached to
the people. Mr. Aston left Creaton about two years before.
The first year of the interval was supplied by Mr. Robertson,
afterwards of Wellingborough; and the second, by an interesting
young man of the name of Jocelyne, who was on probation,
and had received a call from the Church to remain, but
was prevented entering on the pastoral office by death. He
ruptured a blood-vessel by digging one day in the garden; went
to the west of England for the benefit of his health; but
was soon called, as we hope, to the country where none of the
inhabitants shall say any more, I am sick.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">J. Williams.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>We find a record of forty-seven members as belonging
to the Church when Mr. Williams commenced his
labours, and fifty-one were admitted during his ministry,
which continued until March, 1840. Of the removal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Mr. Williams it is stated, "that it was owing to the
secession of some individuals from the Church and
congregation, who, being Baptists, succeeded in raising
a Baptist interest in Spratton, about a mile from
Creaton. Mr. Williams very handsomely left 150
volumes for the use of his successors."</p>

<p>Mr. Martin succeeded Mr. Williams as pastor. His
first visit was in May, 1840, when he preached two
Sabbaths. Mr. Fletcher, from Highbury, preached
five Sabbaths as a probationer, but retired on discovering
that the congregation was not unanimous. Mr.
Martin preached four Sabbaths in August and September,
when he received an invitation to become a
probationer for three months, at the close of which he
was unanimously called to the pastoral office, and was
ordained April 28th, 1841; when Messrs. Bull, of
Newport, Prust, of Northampton, Griffiths, of Buckby,
Harry, of London, and Toller, of Kettering, were engaged
in the principal services of the day. The ministry
of Mr. Martin continued here for little more than seven
years; for it is recorded that he preached his farewell
sermon at Creaton on Sabbath-day afternoon, May 21st,
1848, having accepted an invitation to the pastorate of
Whitefield Chapel, Wilson Street, Long Acre, London.
During his ministry forty-five members were added to
the Church.</p>

<p>Mr. Mandeno, from Newport, Salop, the present
pastor of the Church, entered on his stated engagements
at Creaton on the first Sabbath in October, 1848.
The present number of communicants is 60. There
are 80 children in the Sabbath-school.</p>

<p>Occasional services are conducted in two villages
in the vicinity of Creaton.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>MEMORIALS OF THE INDEPENDENT CHURCH AT
DAVENTRY.</h3>


<p>Circumstances of rather common and incidental
occurrence are sometimes the immediate precursors of
events which are followed by important results to future
generations, while they may have a bearing on the eternal
interests of a number of undying spirits. Something
of this nature appears in the origin of the
Christian Church, of the Independent denomination,
in the town of Daventry.</p>

<p>Nonconformity took early root in this place. After
the Bartholomew Act, secret meetings for worship
were frequently held late at night, and conducted occasionally
by ministers, at a house in the hamlet of Drayton,
where considerable numbers from the town and
neighbourhood often assembled, in which was a backdoor
opening into the fields, to facilitate retreat in case
of detection&mdash;no unnecessary precaution, in those days
of persecution. A Mr. Worth, ejected from the living
of Kilsby, preached at Daventry for some time after
his ejectment.</p>

<p>The following account was given to Dr. Ashworth,
about the year 1747, by Mr. Thomas Porter, a member
of the Church, then 80 years of age, or upwards&mdash;a
man of a very respectable character and remarkably
sensible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>An aged minister, who lived some considerable distance
beyond Daventry, in his way to London lay at the Swan Inn
(formerly the principal inn) in this town, where he was taken
ill, and confined for a week or longer. Mr. Lindsey, who
kept the house, and all his family, behaved to him with much
kindness, and it appears to have been a very regular house.
The minister, on the evening before he departed, desired the
family to come into his room, when he particularly thanked
Mr. Lindsey and each of his family for their civility to him,
and expressed much satisfaction in the good order of the
house; "but," said he, "something leads me to fear there is
not the fear of God in this house. It grieves me to see such
honesty, civility, economy, and decency, and yet religion is
wanting, which is 'the one thing needful.'" On this, he
entered into a close conversation on the nature and importance
of real and inward religion, which he closed with telling
them he had with him a little book, lately printed, which he
would give them, and wished them to read it carefully; then
gave them 'Baxter's Poor Man's Family Book.' This fixes
the date to 1672, or later&mdash;the year in which that book was
printed.</p>

<p>It is not certain who the minister was, or that Mr. Lindsey
ever saw him again or knew his name; but it is suspected
that it was Baxter himself. Mr. Lindsey read the book with
pleasure, sent for other of Mr. Baxter's works, and he, and
some of his children, became excellent characters.</p>

<p>Upon this he grew weary of the inn, and, being in plentiful
circumstances, retired to a house in the middle of High Street,
which had a small close behind it, at the extremity of which,
upon the Back Lane, there stood some out-buildings, which he
converted into a Meeting House. The people enjoyed it during
his life, having now got a settled minister, and formed
into a Church. This was probably after the Revolution. He
always intended, and often promised, to settle it in form;
but dying suddenly, it never was done. The heir-at-law was
well inclined to it, but melancholy, so that the people dare
not trust to a settlement from him. At length they purchased
it of those in whom it was vested, repaired it, and continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
to use it until 1722, when Mr. Mattock, then the minister at
Daventry, built the present place, the old one being by this
time much too small.</p></blockquote>

<p>"The original license granted to Mr. Lindsey, or, as
he is there called, Linzey, in pursuance of the royal
Declaration of Indulgence, with the signatures of the
King and Lord Arlington, the Secretary of State,"

County of Northampton,' "is now in my possession;

<p>This society ranks with the Independent or Congregational,
and not the Presbyterian denomination, as

<p>At what time a settled ministry was first enjoyed
here is not exactly known; but the first pastor of the
Church was Mr. Andrew Barnett, born at Uppington,
in Shropshire, the youngest of ten children. His
father, Mr. Humfrey Barnett, appears to have been
celebrated as a preacher, and as a man of devoted consistent
character. People in the country around would
flock to hear him twice on the Lord's-day, which was
a very unusual thing in those times. He refused to
read the 'Book of Sports,' and preached against it; but
was cited by the Bishop, and obliged to retire out of
that diocese. He was accounted one of the first Puritans
in Shropshire, principally on account of his
serious preaching and his devoted life. This son, who
became pastor of the Church at Daventry, was educated
at Trinity College, Cambridge&mdash;was ejected
from the rectory of Roddington, in Shropshire, in 1662.
He did not suffer so much for his Nonconformity as
many of his brethren; having some knowledge of medicine,
his skill in diseases obtained him favour among
the neighbouring gentry. But on one occasion, being
invited privately to preach on the Lord's-day, a neighbouring
justice came in while he was praying, and
fined him for preaching. Mr. Barnett appealed to the
quarter sessions, and pleaded that he had not preached,
for he was only engaged in prayer; but his plea was
overruled, for the King's Attorney declared that the
defendant's praying was preaching; so that on this
judgment he was cast, and his fine doubled. He had
to pay 40. He was a man of considerable solidity of
judgment, a useful preacher, and highly valued by
those who best knew him. He published a funeral
sermon for Queen Mary, from Psalm ii. 3, 4, dated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Daventry, May 21, 1694; and entitled, 'The Helmet
of Hope, Christ in us the hope of glory.'</p>

<p>Thomas Flavell, the eldest son of John Flavell, the
eminent Nonconformist divine, was the next pastor;
but of his life and ministry we have no account.</p>

<p>John Mason appears to have succeeded Mr. Flavell
for a short time. The father of Mr. Mason was rector
of Water Stratford, in Buckinghamshire, where he died
in 1724, having ministered there for 20 years. He
was the author of the 'Select Remains' which form
the golden little volume that Dr. Watts so highly recommended
to the public. Mr. Mason did not remain
at Daventry more than a year or two, when he removed
to Spaldwich, in Huntingdonshire, where he
died. He was the father of John Mason, author of
the well-known treatise on 'Self-knowledge,' who
was first minister at Dorking, in Surrey, and subsequently
at Cheshunt, in Hertfordshire, where he
preached to a considerable congregation. His diligence
was attested by his labours as a pastor, tutor, and
author. Several of his works are of a very useful
character, though not rising to the highest order of
excellence.</p>

<p>Mr. John Cambden was the next pastor. His ministry
was only for a short time; but whether he died
here, or removed, is not known. He published a
'Funeral Sermon upon the Death of Madam Mary
Thornton, the pious relict of the late truly virtuous
and honourable John Thornton, Esq., of Brock Hall, in
Northamptonshire, who departed this life June 19,
1713. Preached at Daventry; with some account of her
life.'</p>

<p>Mr. Jolly, their next minister, continued with them
a rather longer time; but before the year 1720, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
gave place to a successor in Mr. Daniel Mattock, who
ministered for about 14 years. His preaching appears
to have been so attractive and successful that it considerably
raised the interest, and rendered it necessary
to erect a larger Meeting House, which was done in
the year 1722, and is the building which is now standing.
In a letter of Dr. Doddridge's, dated December
22, 1726, he says&mdash;"Mr. Mattock goes on most triumphantly
at Daventry, and makes the most illustrious
figure of all Mr. Jenning's pupils in these parts." Mr.
Mattock exerted himself to preach the Gospel in the
neighbouring villages, as well as to the stated congregation
at Daventry.</p>

<p>There are two anecdotes related in reference to these
village services, which illustrate the spirit in which
they were regarded by different clergymen in the
vicinity.</p>

<p>While Mr. Mattock was minister of Daventry, having
several persons belonging to his congregation who
came from villages in the vicinity, and being desirous
of extending the knowledge of the Gospel as far as his
time and strength would admit, he proposed to some of
his country friends to get their houses registered for
places of religious worship. This being done, Mr.
Mattock went on a Lord's-day evening, for the first
time, to one of the villages, and preached a lecture.
The clergyman of the parish, hearing of this "rude
intrusion," as he termed it, felt much exasperated, and
determined to go and remonstrate against it. As he
was going to the house where the service was held, he
met, much to his annoyance, several of his parishioners
coming from the lecture. In the height of his resentment
he addressed first one, and then another, "What,
have you been to the conventicle?" "What! have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
you been to hear the fanatic?" "Are you not ashamed
of your conduct?" &amp;c. Soon, however, he arrived at
the house; and Mr. Mattock, being apprized of his
coming, very politely accosted him, and offered him his
chair, begging him to be seated&mdash;which genteel request
he, with apparent reluctance, condescended to comply
with. Being seated, the Rector begins by saying,
"So, I find that you have been preaching here."
"Yes, sir." "And pray, sir, what right have you to
come into my parish, to invade my province? This
parish is <i>mine</i>, and I am their <i>lawful</i> pastor. I wish
therefore to know, by what authority you take this
liberty." "Sir," replied Mr. Mattock, "I beg leave
to inform you, if you do not already know, that I am
qualified according to law as a Dissenting minister,
and am therefore authorized to do as I have done."
"Aye! who authorized you, sir, to invade my province?"
"The legislature, sir, by the Act of Toleration.
I do nothing by preaching here, but what is
strictly legal." "Well, it is strange to me that the
legislature should allow you this liberty." "I hope,
sir," said Mr. Mattock, "that you do not find fault
with the legislature of your country." "No, no, God
forbid that I should; but I still wonder that it should
grant you such an indulgence. But, sir, I have another
question to ask you; pray what is your object
in coming here? what do you propose to yourself in
doing it?" "Sir, my only motive is the hope of doing
good to my fellow creatures." "Good!" replied the
Rector, with a contemptuous sneer: "I don't know what
good <i>you</i> can expect to do, for <i>I</i> can do no good upon
them. They are a parcel of fools. I can make <i>a fool</i>
of the wisest of them, in a quarter of an hour." "Sir,"
says Mr. Mattock, "you give your neighbours a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
bad character; but however, if they are bad as you
represent them, they have the more need of instruction,
that they may be convinced of their folly, and be made
wise unto salvation; and if it pleases God to bless the
instructions of his word, it will be so, and my desire
will be accomplished." To this he made no reply, but
casting his eyes round the house, says, "but can you
imagine that God Almighty will condescend to notice
any worship which is performed in such a place as this?
Solomon thought that he could not make the holy
Temple, which he dedicated to the worship of the Deity,
fine enough for the purpose; therefore to suppose such
condescension as you seem to expect in the Deity is
to affront him." Mr. Mattock replied, "Sir, we know
no holiness of places in Gospel times, but all places
are alike holy where 'God is worshipped in spirit and
in truth'; and we have every reason to hope for and
expect the presence and blessing of Christ, who has
said, 'Where two or three are gathered together in my
name, there am I in the midst of them.'" "But,"
asks the clergyman, "is this place secured for this purpose
by law?" "Yes, sir, it is registered in the
Bishop's court." "And do you intend to make a practice
of coming here?" "I shall come, sir, when it is
convenient to myself, and as long as the people give
me encouragement by their attendance to do so."</p>

<p>Upon this the Rector rose hastily and departed; but
he sent his clerk the next morning to inquire of Mr.
Mattock three things&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Whether he was qualified as a Dissenting minister
to preach?</p>

<p>2. Whether the place he occupied as a place of
worship was legally secured?</p>

<p>3. Whether he intended to continue coming there?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>To this Mr. Mattock replied, "I answered these
three questions in the affirmative last night; but if
your master was not satisfied, why did he not come
himself, or send for me?" The honest clerk said
"that his master could not do either, because <i>he was
going out with the hounds</i>." Admirable apology!</p>

<p>But there was another instance, which presented
a pleasing contrast to this. Mr. Mattock, having
preached in another village on the Lord's-day evening,
was returning home the next morning, and the
clergyman of the parish, having been to take a short
ride, met Mr. Mattock; so, after the usual compliments
were exchanged, the clergyman said, "So I
perceive, sir, that you have been sowing some seed
in my parish." "Yes, sir." "Well," replied the
worthy Vicar, "I am glad of it; and may God grant
that the seed which you sow, and that which I sow,
may both spring up together, and do good to the souls
of men."</p>

<p>At length, to the deep regret of the congregation,
Mr. Mattock accepted an invitation to remove to Birmingham.
This we suppose to have taken place about
1734.</p>

<p>In some extracts from the diary of Mrs. Savage,
daughter of Philip Henry, we find the following
notices of Mr. Mattock. Under date of December
8th, 1740:&mdash;"This morning good Mr. Mattock, of
Birmingham, entertained us awhile with his good
company. He said, my father was in many things
like Abraham, which made me look over a small collection
I made long ago from annotations on John 9th,
that they that would prove themselves the children of
Abraham must endeavour to follow his example, come
at God's call, follow wherever he leads, and resign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
their dearest interests; be strangers and sojourners in
the world; keep up the worship of God in their families;
and above all, must always walk before God in
uprightness."</p>

<p>Again:&mdash;"<i>March 12th, 1744</i> (<i>Monday</i>).&mdash;Sad tidings
of the sudden illness and death of good Mr.
Mattock, minister of the Old Meeting at Birmingham.
A very useful person. Such good ministers the world
can ill spare. A stroke of the palsy. Lord, what is
man&mdash;the wisest, the best, the most healthful? What
shall we say? what shall we do? Thou hast the
ordering of all events. 'The righteous perish; we
should lay it to heart.' It is affecting to see such
taken away, and such left&mdash;poor worthless creatures
as I yet left."</p>

<p>During two years, the congregation at Daventry
was supplied by neighbouring ministers and probationary
candidates.</p>

<p>The next pastor, Mr. James Floyd, was ordained
May 6th, 1736. About ten years after this, at Midsummer,
1746, Mr., afterwards Dr., Caleb Ashworth
was chosen his assistant, and in September of the
same year co-pastor. In a few years after, Mr. Floyd
wholly resigned in favour of his colleague; but continued
to reside in the town till his death, which
took place July 24th, 1759, in his 55th year. His
successor preached his funeral sermon, and at the
desire of the family and congregation published it,
under the title of 'Hope, the Christian mourner's
relief.'</p>

<p>Dr. Ashworth was born in Lancashire in 1719,
educated for the ministry at Northampton under Dr.
Doddridge, who recommended him in his will for his
successor in the following terms:&mdash;"And I do hereby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
declare, that so far as I can judge no man living will
be more fit for the office, since the removal of my dear
friend and associate, Mr. Job Orton, than the Rev.
Mr. Caleb Ashworth, of Daventry; and if it should
so happen, as I think it very probably may, that the
congregation should desire to put themselves under
his ministerial care, I do hereby make my dying request
to him that he would accept the united charge,
and thereby perpetuate those schemes which he knows
I am forming for the public service, the success of
which is far dearer to me than my own life." Coward's
trustees approved of the nomination, and Mr.
Ashworth refusing to quit his pastoral charge at
Daventry, the academy was removed thither in 1752.
He was presented with an unsolicited diploma of D.D.
from a Scotch University in 1759.</p>

<p>On the 18th of July, 1775, he died of dropsy in the
chest, and was buried in the Churchyard, where an
altar stone is placed to his memory, on which is the
following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
Here rest in hope,<br />
the remains of the Rev. <span class="smcap">Caleb Ashworth</span>, D.D.;<br />
pastor of a congregation of Protestant Dissenters,<br />
and director of the academy in this town.<br />
He died<br />
July 18, 1775, aged 54.<br />
With indefatigable application,<br />
with genuine well-regulated zeal,<br />
and with growing reputation and success,<br />
he exerted his eminent abilities<br />
and extensive acquaintance with sacred and human literature<br />
in the service of his great Master,<br />
and in promoting the important interests<br />
of learning, religion, and charity.<br />
<br />
"Blessed is that servant whom his Lord when<br />
he cometh shall find so doing."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></div>

<p>Mr. Samuel Palmer, who had been a pupil of the
Doctor's, published 'The Want of Labourers in the
Gospel Harvest considered and improved'&mdash;a sermon
preached at Hackney on occasion of the death of Dr.
Ashworth. Several others, in different publications,
have eulogized their tutor in the highest terms; one
of them, in a memoir of a fellow student, observes&mdash;"Dr.
Ashworth was a man who, though not distinguished
by that acumen of genius and vigour of imagination
which some have possessed, yet by strong
sense, inflexible resolution, and indefatigable labour,
acquired a store of theological learning not often exceeded,
and through a long train of years discharged
the office of divinity tutor with a respectability and
success which have seldom been equalled."</p>

<p>Some of the Doctor's students becoming Unitarians,
suspicion has been expressed as to the evangelical
soundness of the views entertained by the tutor; but
the evil appears to have been, that there was a sub-tutor
who took the heretical side on disputed points,
while the principal tutor, with all his love for truth,
indulged his candour and kindness to excess. Dr.
Priestley says "that Dr. Ashworth took the orthodox
side of every question," and "that Dr. Ashworth was
earnestly desirous to make me as orthodox as possible."</p>

<p>The Doctor was author of 'Reflections on the Fall of
a Great Man&mdash;a Funeral Sermon on 2nd Sam. iii. 38,
on the Death of Dr. Watts, 1749'; a funeral sermon
for Mr. Floyd; also, a funeral sermon for Mr. Clark,
of Birmingham, entitled 'The Regard Christian Congregations
owe to their Deceased Ministers represented
and urged, from Heb. xiii. 7'; 'A Collection of Psalm
Tunes, with an Introduction to the Art of Singing;'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
also, 'A Hebrew Grammar, with complete Paradigms
of the Verbs'; 'An Easy Introduction to Plane Trigonometry,'
&amp;c.</p>

<p>Mr. Robins was the next pastor and tutor. After
the death of Dr. Ashworth, it became a matter of great
anxiety amongst the friends of the academy who
should be appointed his successor. There was one
to whom many eyes were turned; but great fears were
entertained, lest the extreme diffidence and modesty
of his spirit should prevent him from acceding to the
earnest requests that were presented to him. This
was the Rev. Thomas Robins, who was at this time
minister at West Bromwich, in Staffordshire. He
was born at Keysoe, near Bedford; studied for the
ministry under Dr. Doddridge, at Northampton; first
settled at Stretton, in Warwickshire, 1755. The present
minister's house at Stretton was built for him. He
came to West Bromwich in 1761, where he continued
until his removal to Daventry, in 1775.</p>

<p>At this period Job Orton wrote&mdash;"The death of
Dr. Ashworth, though it has been long expected, has
been a very painful event to me. Mr. Robins preached
his funeral sermon last Lord's-day to a great auditory,
from these words: 'Where is the Lord God of Elijah?'
Coward's trustees, all the neighbouring ministers, and
many in this and other neighbourhoods, think that no
person is more proper to fill up this vacancy than Mr.
Robins, especially as he is exceedingly acceptable to
the congregation at Daventry. He hath been strongly
urged to take up the prophet's mantle, but he has an
unconquerable diffidence of his own abilities; I wish
the many applications he hath received from ministers
of all sentiments and denominations may overcome it.
If he absolutely refuse, I know not who will be thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
of. I pray God to direct in this very important concern."
In another letter he writes&mdash;"You have heard
by this time, August 31st, 1775, that Mr. Robins has
accepted the invitation to Daventry. I had a great
deal of trouble in writing to him, and engaging all my
friends and correspondents to apply to him, who all
concurred in thinking him the most proper person. I
do not know a single objection, and I cannot hear of
anyone else that makes one. The divines and the
laity, of all principles and persuasions in these parts,
are agreed in their opinion of him, and everybody is
well pleased that he has accepted the office. I look
back with pleasure and thankfulness on the pains I
have taken in this affair, and firmly believe I shall
never have reason to repent it."</p>

<p>Mr. Robins printed 'An Abridgement of Matthew
Henry's Work on the Lord's Supper,' which was the
only work he could be prevailed on to print, excepting
some memoirs of Mr. Thomas Strange, of Kilsby,
"one of the wisest and best of men." Mr. Palmer, of
Hackney, says, "This was done on my earnest solicitation;
and those who are the best judges on such a
subject, and who best knew Mr. Strange, will concur
with me in pronouncing this so excellent a performance,
as to render it a matter of deep regret that the
same pen should have been employed in no other original
composition."</p>

<p>Robert Hall has written, in his 'Memoir of the Rev.
T. N. Toller'&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Among many other mental endowments, Mr. Robins was
remarkable for delicacy of taste and elegance of diction; and
perhaps my readers will excuse my observing, that the first
perceptions of these qualities which the writer of these lines
remembers to have possessed, arose from hearing him preach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
at Northampton, on a public occasion. It is to be lamented
that he has left none of those productions behind him, which
a correct and beautiful imagination, embodied in language of
the most classic purity, rendered so impressive and delightful.
The qualities of his heart corresponded to those of his genius;
and though long before his death his bodily infirmities obliged
him to relinquish a commanding station and retire into obscurity,
he retained to the last such an ascendancy over the
minds of his former pupils, and such an interest in their
affections, as nothing but worth of the highest order can
command.</p></blockquote>

<p>We may here correct an error into which Mr. Hall
has fallen, in stating that Mr. Robins <i>was first assistant</i>
to Dr. Ashworth. He did not come to reside at Daventry
until the death of Dr. Ashworth, as his successor.
But while the friends of Mr. Robins were delighting
themselves in his ability and success, lo! in the midst
of his days and his usefulness, he is compelled to resign
all public services and retire into private life. After
discharging his offices with increasing reputation and
success for six years, his ministerial usefulness was
suddenly destroyed, by imprudently preaching three
times to a large congregation at Kettering one Sabbath
whilst labouring under a severe cold, by which exertion
he irrecoverably lost his voice; and being thus incapacitated
for fulfilling the duties of the pulpit or the
lecture-room, he relinquished his public engagements,
and with great humility and contentment passed the
remainder of his life in the secular employment of a
bookseller and druggist. He died May 20th, 1810,
and was buried in the Churchyard, where, on an upright
stone, is inscribed a high eulogium, from the pen
of his pupil and successor.</p>

<p>The Rev. T. N. Toller, of Kettering, who studied
in the academy at Daventry, and spent the last year of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
his course under Mr. Robins, improved the death of his
former tutor in a discourse delivered to his own people
the next Sabbath morning, from 2 Kings ii. 12: "And
Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the
chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof! And he
saw him no more."</p>

<p>It is a high gratification to the writer, and he trusts
it will prove such to the reader, that he has the opportunity
of enriching these 'Memorials' with Mr. Toller's
description of the character of Mr. Robins, as given in
the closing part of this sermon, having transcribed it
from the author's manuscript,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> never before published.</p>

<blockquote><p>I have been this last week to assist in depositing in the
dust one of the most amiable and excellent of men. There
was not one friend present, I believe, but felt the weight of
his worth, when his remains were let down into the silent
grave, not excepting the clergyman who buried him&mdash;who, in
a room full of Dissenting ministers, bore the most explicit and
honourable testimony to his name. But there was a sense in
which the person who now addresses you might, perhaps, with
more propriety than any individual there, adopt and apply
the peculiar language of the distressed prophet, "My father,
my father!" I felt, when I stood by his grave, that I had
lost a father&mdash;that I was interring a father; for I always
looked up to him, and venerated and loved him, as a parent;
for truly he had been a father to me. I was his senior student:
the last and most important year of my academical
course I spent under his roof and tuition: he taught and
treated me as a son. It was owing to his advice, under God,
that I am this day standing in this pulpit; his decided
opinion had more weight with me than that of everybody
else. I did always implicitly confide in his judgment. I was
sure of his prudence; could entirely trust his fidelity. On
a hundred occasions have I experienced his tenderness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
his kindness, and, blessed be God! never did I receive in
all my intercourse a frown from him; while a hint, by way
of reproof, from him, would have had more weight and gone
further into my heart than a hundred stripes from another
hand. And during all the thirty-four years which have
elapsed since I left his roof, I have always secretly considered
him as my principal, standing, stable friend, to whose
judgment and kindness I could with most confidence look
under any particular difficulty, exigency, or perplexity; so
that you may suppose, under these circumstances, in connexion
with the thought of having buried the greater part of the friends
of my youth&mdash;you must suppose that, in attending such a funeral,
I must have felt very peculiar sensations; that I was
burying a friend indeed: I will not say the nearest and dearest
by the ties of nature, for that is not true; but my most
valuable, confidential, intellectual, religious, particular friend.</p>

<p>But not only were these sentiments excited by my own
personal feeling; they were strengthened by the unanimous
testimony of all who had any thorough intimacy with him&mdash;any
comprehensive knowledge of his qualifications and character.
I believe, never did any man go down to the grave
followed by more genuine sentiments of respect from those
that knew him, and were capable of appreciating his real
worth.</p>

<p>There have been more brilliant, shining, striking, nay, useful
characters than he (for during the last thirty years of his
life Providence mysteriously laid him aside from a sphere of
usefulness for which he was peculiarly adapted, and in which
he gave universal satisfaction); but taking him altogether,
considered as a whole, he was the most consistent, accurate
character I ever knew in my life.</p>

<p>As a man, as a friend, a literary character, a person of
general knowledge, an amiable, honourable, upright, uniform,
devotional Christian, I never knew his equal. I can truly say,
with an eminent London minister, "his was the completest
character I ever knew." Nor, in this sense, do I think he
has left his equal behind him; there was such a coincidence,
such a collection, such an assemblage of excellences, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
were always very striking to his friends. Some people have
great excellences of one kind, and great corresponding faults
of another; but there was such a balance of qualities of everything
in him, as I have often been charmed with and admired.
Oh, that I could say more! And many and many a time
have I left his company with this reflection: "Surely this is
the disciple that Jesus loves; for where can I look round and
find a man in so many respects so much like himself?" And
that mixture of reverence and love which I have always experienced
in his company has put me in mind of what I could
not but suppose I must feel, only in a far greater degree, if I
were admitted into the presence and to the conversation of
the blessed Redeemer.</p>

<p>His fine sense, clearness of understanding, skill and dexterity
in stating a subject or conducting an argument; the
extent of his knowledge upon most subjects that could be
called important or useful ones; and all this connected with
the sweetness of his temper, the humility of his manner and
deportment, the liveliness and affability of his address, what
I may call the ingenuity as well as Christianity of his character;&mdash;for
I have often heard it remarked, and often observed
it myself, that were an absent person censured or
slandered, if there was anything to be said in his favour
Mr. Robins would find out what was to be said, and would
make you see that it was not a blind and suppositious notion
that dictated it, but that there was reason in what he
said. Nevertheless, he could be angry at sin, and yet sin not.
He could reprove folly with a frown that a man must <i>be all
a fool</i> if he did not feel. It has been said, that some of his
more distant relations, that were rather wild in their conduct,
though they could not but love him, were more afraid of him
than of any other man upon earth: such is the force of the
frown of goodness. I this week heard a person say, that a
frown from him would have gone deeper than from any man
in the world.</p>

<p>Realizing, my friends, such traits as these, which I am sure
nobody that knew him could or would contradict, in connexion
with the richness and fulness of his piety, the evangelical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
and scriptural consistency of his sentiments, the depth
of his love to the Saviour, his deep conviction of the truth of
the Gospel and dependence upon it (for he died as a poor
sinner, wholly resting there; and again, and again, and again
said, What a poor miserable creature I should be without the
Gospel!)&mdash;if he had been literally the very chief of sinners, he
could not have seemed to depend less upon anything he was
or had done in a meritorious sense; he would not even bear
to hear any hints about his former qualifications as a minister,
or his honourable conduct as a Christian, which all that knew
him, knew his great Master would include under the final
"Well done, good and faithful servant," and place among
the "works of faith and labours of love," and never forget
them:&mdash;if, I say, you realize all this, in connexion with his
respectability, integrity, and punctuality as a tradesman since
he became one, and his universal influence and weight in the
town where he resided (a situation by no means advantageous
to him in this respect as a Dissenter), can you wonder that
one is charmed with such a character? Would it have been
right that I should have passed it by in silent contemplation
for my own edification only?</p>

<p>When he was capable of exercising his ministerial function,
there was a peculiar sweetness and gracefulness in his attitude
and delivery in the pulpit; great seriousness of air and manner,
and a wonderful copiousness and variety and readiness,
in his prayers; a vein of the most humble yet elevated piety
running through the whole&mdash;an evangelical savour, clothed
always with the utmost propriety and sometimes unaffected
elegance of expression. Since he was laid aside from pulpit
labours, if we could prevail upon him to pray at our ministers'
meetings in private, it was the richest feast of the day; and
in connexion with his disabled circumstances as to public
work, he would sometimes dissolve all into tears. I remember,
at the close of these occasions, a very respectable minister,
with his eyes bathed in tears, whispered to me, "This man
prays like an angel."</p>

<p>In his sermons, which were well finished compositions of their
kind, there was this peculiarity&mdash;that they were highly acceptable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
and edifying to all descriptions of serious sensible people,
among the poor and the rich, the learned and the unlearned&mdash;poor
people that had good sense as well as piety, and learned
people that had piety as well as good sense: all, in a word,
who had good sense to understand him, and piety to relish
what he said, used to love to hear Mr. Robins. The last time
he ever preached within these walls (on which occasion he
attempted to exert himself more than usual, owing to the
largeness of the place compared with his own), he appears to
have got his bane. He strained the organs of speech so as to
bring on the disease that laid him aside. He preached on
that passage, "The path of the just is as the shining light,
that shineth more and more unto the perfect day." I have
often thought since, as redounding to the credit of this congregation,
of the universal satisfaction which that sermon
gave to all descriptions of well-disposed hearers&mdash;the plainest
and most illiterate Christian, as well as those best informed.
The case was this: though he was one of the finest of composers,
yet he spake from the heart; and what he said went
to the heart.</p>

<p>Since he was laid aside, though his usefulness was greatly
curtailed, yet he was far from being useless. Modesty prevented
his ever publishing any of his own compositions; yet
as a friend, as an adviser, as a companion, he has been eminently
useful. A respectable minister at his funeral said,
"he never, with one exception only, gained so much instruction
from any man in private conversation as from
Mr. Robins."</p>

<p>Though laid aside from the service of the sanctuary, he
lived respected and beloved to his seventy-seventh year; and
when attended to his grave, not only was he accompanied by
a number of as sincere mourners as ever followed a corpse, but
the nearest earthly relation he had, and whom he had patronized
from infancy, was utterly incapable of joining the train&mdash;sat
weeping over her Bible, and almost stupified with grief,
saying, "he was all the world to her: and him she had lost."
Here is the cutting thought suggested in the text, that went
nearer to the surviving prophet than any other&mdash;"his master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
was taken from his head," "and he saw him no more." This
thought I felt when I stood close by his grave: "I shall see
him no more. Here I take my final leave. I have received
my last instruction. I shall hear his voice and behold his
countenance no more." But while I was weeping over this
clause, those words in the burial service went down with an
emphasis to my heart, never felt by any grave before&mdash;words
too promiscuously applied, too often; but their special appropriateness
to him struck us all&mdash;"As much as it hath
pleased Almighty God of his great goodness to take to himself
the soul of our dear brother here departed, we commit his
body to the ground, earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to
dust, in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal
life." "Ah!" thought I, "you may say it in all its emphasis
over this grave. I will not go away saying, with the prophet,
'I shall see him no more'; blessed be God for the hope that
I shall see him again! Yea, thy brother, thy father, thy minister,
thy tutor, thy friend, shall rise again. May I but be
honoured, O my Judge! with a place at thy right hand, and
with such an addition to my happiness as to be joined in
everlasting bonds of friendship with him I so much loved and
honoured on earth, to improve and enjoy together to all eternity.
Amen."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Thomas Belsham, who had been assistant tutor
here in metaphysics, mathematics, and natural history,
till 1778, when he settled at Worcester, succeeded Mr.
Robins in 1781, and returned to Daventry, at the solicitation
of the congregation and the trustees, in the
double capacity of pastor and principal or theological
tutor. He continued here until 1789, when, having
fully embraced Unitarian sentiments, his continuance
in the office of tutor being directly contrary to the will
of the founder of the academy, he apprized the trustees
of the change, and resigned the situation. After this
the academy returned again to Northampton.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Willis Paterson was the next pastor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
He had recently completed his course of study here;
but in 1796 he accepted an invitation from the congregations
at Bardon Park and Ashby-de-la-Zouch, in
Leicestershire, when he went to reside at Donnington-on-the-Heath,
where he died in August, 1812.</p>

<p>Mr. John Morrell, afterwards LL.D., was chosen to
succeed him, but removed in about two years, and became
minister of a Unitarian Chapel at Brighton, in
Sussex.</p>

<p>Mr. George Watson was invited to the pastoral
office in October, 1799. He was a native of Kettering;
and, becoming early decided for the Saviour, he
devoted himself to the work of the ministry. He became
a member of the Church at Kettering, under the
ministry of Mr. Boyce. In the records of that Church
we find this statement:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Sept. 3rd, 1772.</i>&mdash;At our Church-meeting, George Watson,
son of Mr. Wm. Watson, our clerk, who had before dedicated
himself to the work of the ministry and entered upon a
course of preparatory studies for it, having in writing given
an account of the dealings of God with his soul, was admitted
to full communion with us.</p></blockquote>

<p>He pursued his studies in the academy at Daventry;
was first settled at Howick, in Lancashire; afterwards
became assistant preacher to the Rev. Thomas Taylor,
of Carter Lane, London, from whence he was invited
to this congregation, over which he presided until
1816, when he resigned and went to reside at Birmingham,
where he died, August 1st, 1817, in the 66th
year of his age. He published 'Liberality to the Poor
and Sick recommended, in a Sermon preached at Harwich
for the benefit of the Manchester Infirmary, 1792';
'A brief Memoir of the Rev. Thomas Robins, late of
Daventry; with a Sketch of the Sermon preached May<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
26th, 1810, on occasion of his Death; and some Biographical
additions.' The congregation was unsettled
after this for two years, when Mr. John Whittenbury
succeeded Mr. Watson in the pastoral office, and was
ordained here February 8th, 1818. During his ministry
two new galleries were added to the Meeting
House.</p>

<p>Mr. Whittenbury, we learn, entered the academy at
Rotherham in the year 1808, then under the able
tuition of the late Dr. Williams. Having passed
through the usual course of study, he was first ordained
at Darlington, July 28th, 1814, where he laboured
with great assiduity, and, although amidst
many discouragements, not without some tokens of the
divine blessing. He at length accepted an invitation
to become the pastor of the Church at Daventry, and
continued his labours here for eight years. He subsequently
removed to a destitute congregation at Newport,
Salop; from thence he went to Liverpool, in 1838,
to endeavour to revive an interest that had fallen into
decay. Failing in the accomplishment of this object,
he then devoted his time and energies to promote the
interests of the various religious societies connected
with the town, particularly "the Town Mission,"
"the Seaman's Friend Society," and "Bethel Union,"
by the committees of which he was held in great
esteem. He died January 3rd, 1845, aged 55 years.</p>

<p>Mr. J. Davis, the present minister, succeeded Mr.
Whittenbury, becoming the pastor of this Church in
the year 1826.</p>

<p>"In 1728, the congregation purchased a house in
Sheaf Street for the residence of the minister, which
was rebuilt by subscription at the time Dr. Ashworth
erected the adjoining house for the academy. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Meeting House, which stands in the minister's yard, is
approached from the street through a gateway, and is
a substantial stone building, 42 feet long by 42 feet
wide." It has now three galleries.</p>

<p>During the ministry of the present pastor, new
school-rooms have been erected.</p>

<p>The present number of communicants is 94. There
are 190 children in the Sabbath-schools.</p>

<p>There are some endowments connected with this
place; one, of 12 per annum, towards the support of
a Charity-school for boys and girls.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>MEMORIALS OF THE INDEPENDENT CHURCHES IN
WELLINGBOROUGH.</h3>


<h4>SECTION 1.&mdash;THE CHURCH AT CHEESE LANE.</h4>

<p>Where the events relating to the early history of a
community have not been put upon record about the
time they occurred, or where the records, when made,
have been subsequently neglected and lost, it becomes
scarcely possible to discover its origin, or to obtain
any correct information relating to its progress.</p>

<p>This is the case, we regret to state, with the Independent
Church, Cheese Lane, Wellingborough; it appears
to be scarcely possible now to discover the date
of its origin, or the circumstances under which it was
formed.</p>

<p>In Wellingborough and its vicinity there were
ministers of Christ, 190 years ago, who belonged to
that noble band of worthies who renounced their
worldly prospects in connexion with the Church by
law established, rather than violate the dictates of conscience,
on the passing of the Act of Uniformity in the
year 1662.</p>

<p>Before the days of the ejected ministers, there
resided at the village of Wilby, little more than two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
miles from Wellingborough, Mr. Andrew Perne, A.M.,
a worthy Puritan minister. He was born in 1596;
was chosen Fellow of Katherine Hall, Cambridge,
where he probably received his education. Having
finished his studies at the University, he became rector
of Wilby, in Northamptonshire, where he continued a
laborious, faithful, and successful preacher, 27 years.
He often preached before the Parliament, and several
of his sermons were published, one of which is entitled,
'Gospel Courage; or, a Christian Resolution for God and
his Truth. In a Sermon preached before the Honourable
House of Commons, at Margerett's, Westminster, at a
public Fast, the 21st of May, 1643.' Being called up
to London, he gained a high reputation, and was offered
considerable preferments; but he refused them all, resolving
to return to his charge at Wilby. He appears
to have been a man of considerable eminence and great
usefulness. His awakening sermons, and exemplary
life and conversation, produced a signal and happy reformation;
his people revered and loved him as a
father. "He was full of spiritual warmth," says Mr.
Ainsworth, one of the ejected ministers, who preached
and published his funeral sermon, "filled with a holy
indignation against sin, active in his work, and never
more in his element than when he was in the pulpit."
"As his life was holy, so his death was happy." He
blessed God that he was not afraid to die; nay, he
earnestly desired to be gone, and often cried out, during
his last sickness, "When will that hour come? One
assault more, and this earthen vessel will be broken,
and I shall be with God."</p>

<p>His remains were interred in the chancel of Wilby
Church, where at the foot of the altar is the following
monumental inscription to his memory:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
Here lieth interred <span class="smcap">Mr. Andrew Perne,</span><br />
a faithful servant of Jesus Christ;<br />
a zealous owner ever of God's cause in perilous times;<br />
a powerful and successful preacher of the Gospel;<br />
a great blessing to this town and country,<br />
where he lived twenty-seven years.<br />
He departed, December 13, 1654.<br />
</div>

<p>The influence of the ministry and character of Mr.
Perne would no doubt extend to the town of Wellingborough,
and might be one means of producing that
regard for the principles of the Gospel and the purity
of the Church that actuated the early Nonconformists,
who had many of them to suffer much for the principles
which they maintained, and the course they conscientiously
pursued.</p>

<p>A Mr. Thomas Andrews, of the University of
Cambridge, was ejected from the vicarage of Wellingborough.
The living was given to him by the Lord
or Lady Brooke. While he continued in it, he was
generally respected by the ministers of his neighbourhood,
twelve of whom took their turn at his weekly
lecture on a Wednesday.</p>

<p>His frugality, while he continued the incumbent,
saved him some hundreds of pounds, so that he was
better provided for after his ejectment than many of
his brethren. When cast out of his living, he repaired
to Meers Ashby, where he preached at a Mr. Preston's,
in the night. He often preached also at Lady Tyrrell's.
He was a man of great courage, agreeable behaviour,
and much beloved by his neighbours.</p>

<p>There was also a Mr. Alsop, ejected from the living
of Wilby, near Wellingborough, who came and resided
here after his ejectment, and exercised his ministry as
the times would permit. It is recorded that he was
bound over to the sessions for preaching at Oakham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
and that he lay six months in Northampton Gaol for
praying with a sick person.</p>

<p>Mr. Rowlet, ejected from Sudbury, in this county,
appears to have united with Mr. Alsop in his labours.
In the time of King Charles's Indulgence, there was
a meeting every Lord's-day at Wellingborough, upheld
by Mr. Alsop and Mr. Rowlet, and the latter continued
preaching here until removed by death. His
constitution was feeble, for Mr. Alsop said of him, "If
this man had but a body to his soul, he would be incomparable."
He is represented by such as attended
on his ministry and knew him well, as a most agreeable
preacher, who used to charm his hearers. He
died of consumption.</p>

<p>Mr. Henry Wills, who had been rector of Loddington,
in this county, is said to have preached privately
(probably in some retired place, or in the silent hours
of the night) to the people of Wellingborough, where
his memory was exceedingly precious for a long time,
especially for two things&mdash;the extraordinary suitableness
of his compositions to the minds of the weakest,
notwithstanding the fulness and depth of his matter,
and the great piety and refreshing savour which seasoned
his common conversation. It is related concerning
him, that "he was an able scholar, a considerable
mathematician, of great skill in the law, an eminent
preacher, and of a most agreeable carriage."</p>

<p>How early an Independent Church was first formed
here, from which this in Cheese Lane descended, or
when a stated pastor was first settled over it, we have
not discovered.</p>

<p>It is stated, that this Church first met for divine
worship in a Meeting House situated in a yard at the
back of some premises in Silver Street. In 1746, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
was such an old building, and in such a dilapidated
state, that it was found to be necessary to erect a new
place of worship; when the present Meeting House
was raised at the bottom of the lane where the cheese
fair was kept, and hence called Cheese Lane Meeting.
At that time, Mr. King, who was a friend and correspondent
of Dr. Doddridge's, had been for many years
pastor of the Church.</p>

<p>The earliest notice we find of Mr. King as minister
at Wellingborough is in the controversy with Mr.
Davis, of Rowell, in 1692, in which Mr. King took a
part. We find his name also as minister at Wellingborough,
among those who were present at the ordination
of Mr. Tingey, at Northampton, in the year 1709.</p>

<p>The next notice we have found of Mr. King as minister
here is in a letter from Doddridge addressed to
him, dated December 29th, 1723, in which the writer
engages to visit Mr. King and to preach for him on a
week evening, observing, "It is with the utmost readiness
and pleasure I embrace the opportunity of serving
you which you propose in your obliging letter, especially
as it gives me an opportunity of cultivating that friendship
with which you are pleased to honour me, and which
I look upon as a very particular happiness."</p>

<p>When the dreadful fire that took place in 1738 had
laid waste a considerable part of the town, destroying
205 dwelling-houses besides 806 out-buildings, a fast-day
was kept and some special public religious services
were observed, and Dr. Doddridge was invited to preach
on the occasion. He improved the event in a very
serious, suitable, faithful sermon, from Amos iv. 11,
which was published at the request of the people, with
a dedication to those inhabitants of Wellingborough at
whose request the sermon was published. We expect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
this sermon was preached in the Old Meeting House,
in which the congregation at Cheese Lane formerly
worshipped. In the dedication the Doctor observes&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>I have laboured as much as possible to write from the life.
The ruins of your town, the distress of your families, and the
mixture of hope and fear attending the present situation of
your affairs, have been as it were before my eyes and on my
heart in almost every sentence; and I have frequently mingled
these meditations with earnest prayers to God that he would
so lead me into the secret recesses of your souls, that what you
before heard and will now read may be like a nail fastened in
a sure place.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. King, it is stated, was succeeded by Mr. David
Bradbury, who left Wellingborough about the year
1764, and was succeeded by Mr. French, who kept a
very respectable boarding-school while residing here.
He had studied under Dr. Doddridge, at Northampton.
He afterwards removed to London. Mr. Orton was
the next minister; but in early life he died of consumption,
about the year 1776. Then succeeded to
Mr. Orton Mr. Thomas, who had been a student at the
academy at Daventry, first under Dr. Ashworth and
then under Mr. Robins. He was ordained about the
same time as the late Mr. Toller was settled at Kettering,
they having closed their academical course nearly
together. Mr. Thomas resigned his charge about 1786,
after having been pastor about eight years, and went
to Enfield. He was succeeded by Mr. Robert Jacomb.
He had been in a very unsettled state of health in
London, where he was assistant to the Rev. Hugh
Worthington, at Salter's Hall; and being called to
experience here a very heavy domestic trial, in the
almost sudden death of his wife, when they had been
married but a short time, his depression of spirits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
became so great that he left, though very reluctantly,
and went to Bath.</p>

<p>The successor to Mr. Jacomb was Mr. Henry Summers.
In reference to this change we find the following
statement:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>In consequence of the removal of the Rev. R. Jacomb from
Wellingborough in 1791, the Church and congregation usually
meeting for divine worship in Cheese Lane became destitute
of a pastor and teacher. In this situation it became necessary
for the society to look out for a successor; and in March,
1792, Mr. Henry Summers, who was assistant to the Rev.
Robert Winter, of Hammersmith, after sufficient trial was
made, received a unanimous invitation to the pastoral office,
of which he soon after declared his acceptance. But short
was his time of service: soon was he called to close his labours
on earth. He died of fever, when he had sustained the pastoral
office scarcely four years in this place.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the early part of the year 1796 we find it recorded
"that it pleased divine providence to bereave this
Church and congregation of their pastor, the Rev.
Henry Summers, who, after a short illness, departed
this life January 27th, 1796." His funeral sermon was
preached by the Rev. John Wood, of Rowell. From
the time of his death until Midsummer, the congregation
was supplied partly by the neighbouring ministers,
who voluntarily offered their services for the benefit of
his widow, and partly by the students at the academy
at Northampton. By the general consent of the whole
society, at length an application was made to Mr.
Daniel Washbourn, then a student at Northampton, to
supply them during the academical vacation, with
which he complied. After ministering to them for
several weeks with increasing acceptance and satisfaction,
the Church and congregation determined to invite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
him to become their pastor, and accordingly sent
him a pressing and affectionate invitation, signed by
131 persons, which, after fervent prayer and mature
deliberation, he accepted.</p>

<p>On Thursday, November 3rd, of the same year, the
ordination service took place. The following is the
account preserved of that interesting occasion:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>A very numerous auditory assembled; and from the testimony
of ministers and people, it may be asserted with the
strictest truth, the services of the day were particularly
solemn, suitable, and instructive. Mr. Richard Winter, of
Hanover Street, London, commenced with a short prayer and
reading some suitable portions of Scripture (Ps. xcvi., and
the two first chapters of Paul's Epistle to Titus); Mr. Edwards
engaged in the general prayer; Mr. Worthington, of Salter's
Hall, London, delivered an introductory discourse, in which
he stated with ability and conciseness the grounds and advantages
of such a service among Protestant Dissenters. He
then proposed four questions to Mr. Washbourn, which were
answered by him, and engaged in the ordination prayer&mdash;a
prayer peculiarly solemn and pathetic. The charge, from
Gal. i. 10, last clause, was delivered by Mr. Horsey, of Northampton;
and Mr. Toller, of Kettering, preached the sermon
to the people, from 1 Thess. v. 12, 13: both these discourses
were admirably adapted to the occasion. Mr. Chadwick, of
Oundle, concluded with an excellent prayer. Hymns were
read by Mr. Luccock.</p>

<p>After the dinner, it was unanimously proposed and requested
that the ordination service be published; which was
agreed to by the gentlemen concerned.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>There was a service in the evening, which Mr. Wood, of
Rowell, introduced with prayer; Mr. Winter preached a very
suitable sermon, from 2 Cor. iii. 5; and at the request of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
several of the ministers, Mr. Washbourn concluded the solemnities
of the day with prayer. The kind providence of
God appears to smile on this connexion, formed and ratified
between minister and people; both rejoice in the pleasing
prospect of usefulness, harmony, and love. May the great
Head of the Church continue the special tokens of his presence
and regard amongst us! Amen.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus wrote the pastor, under the first impressions
of a happy settlement over this people; and for
nearly sixteen years he continued his labours among
them. During the far larger portion of that time they
appear to have been years of comfort and usefulness;
but, as another instance added to the vast numbers
which show the uncertainty attending the most pleasing
connexions and prospects in this fallen state, at length
such circumstances arose as separated the pastor from
his flock. Some disagreements arising between the
influential members of the Church and congregation,
they went on to such a length as to issue in a separation&mdash;the
building of Salem Chapel, and the formation
of the Church assembling there. This was so painful
to Mr. Washbourn, that he sent in his resignation, in
which he expressed himself in the following words:&mdash;"While
I desire to entertain no sentiments of hostility
towards those who have thought proper to desert my
ministry and to form themselves into a separate community,
I cannot but consider that they are responsible
for my being removed from this part of the Lord's
vineyard, where my labours were honoured with the
divine blessing." Mr. Washbourn removed to Hammersmith,
and never came to Wellingborough again.
While filling this situation it is observed, "that he
enjoyed to a high degree the respect of the surrounding
ministers, particularly that of the late Mr. Toller, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Kettering, whose friendship and popularity he frequently
referred to with peculiar delight."</p>

<p>Mr. Washbourn was minister at Hammersmith for
twenty-two years; and here we find it remarked, "that
his preaching&mdash;solid, judicious, and deeply spiritual&mdash;was
very soon highly estimated by his new charge, the
greater part of whom at that time were families of considerable
standing in society, as well as of high respectability
and influence in the Church. Not a few were
brought to Christ who had seen the meridian of life
unvisited by mercy, and who survived to bless his
memory and to render it blessed." But we find that
"it pleased the great Head of the Church, who retains
the prerogative of determining the trials of his servants,
greatly to obstruct the usefulness of the latter part of
his life, and to render it the scene of peculiar affliction,
by the rapid progress of a constitutional malady&mdash;overwhelming
depression. The most remarkable feature
in this visitation was its periodical character.
Six weeks of unutterable gloom, during which he was
bereft of every ray of spiritual consolation, and an
equal term of unusual enjoyment in religion and in
social intercourse, maintained an almost unvarying
succession throughout the two or three last years of his
earthly pilgrimage. But he has frequently said to
his colleague, 'I know, my dear sir, it is all physical.
I know it&mdash;I have proved it; and I know God sees it
needful for me, or he would not permit it.'"</p>

<p>He died on Monday, the 10th day of November,
1834, in the 64th year of his age; and it is said
"that few public men, moving in a comparatively quiet
and unobtrusive sphere, have gone down to the grave
accompanied by such deep expressions of unequivocal
regard, from all classes in the circle where they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
lived and laboured, as did this devoted minister of
Christ."</p>

<p>Soon after Mr. Washbourn had left Wellingborough,
Mr. Robert Jacomb, the former pastor of the Church,
came on a visit; and seeing the uncomfortable state in
which the people were, he kindly consented to prolong
his stay, and preached to them with his former acceptance.
An invitation was given him to resume his
labours, which he accepted; and after an interval of
twenty years he again became the pastor of the Church.
His services were continued until repeated attacks of
disease, and the increasing infirmities of age, obliged
him to resign his charge in the year 1826. He continued
to reside in Wellingborough until his death,
which took place in the year 1832.</p>

<p>Mr. Jacomb, we have heard, was a descendant from
the early Nonconformist ministers of that name. He
always appeared to conduct himself with the ease,
affability, and politeness of the gentleman, and with
the spirit of the Christian. His temper was amiable,
and it was his constant aim to promote the spirit of
piety and of peace among his people. In the spirit of
devotion, and with a sincere concern for the highest welfare
of his flock, he conducted the services of the sanctuary.
He was highly esteemed to the close of his days.</p>

<p>Mr. James Robertson was the next pastor, commencing
his ministry here in October, 1826. He continued
his services until a distressing mental malady, from
which he never recovered, laid him aside from his
public work and cut him off from the society of his
friends. Mr. Robertson was a native of Newcastle-upon-Tyne;
became a student of Wymondley College;
was pastor for some years of the Independent Church at
Stretton-under-Fosse, commencing his ministry there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
July 29th, 1809, and was ordained in August, 1810.
The ministers officiating were Messrs. H. Knight, R.
Hall, and T. N. Toller. "For upwards of four years
before his death he was the subject of intense mental
and physical suffering, which much beclouded his fine
intellect; and the deep waters of tribulation went over
his soul." "In him," it is justly said, "were united
the elegant accomplishments of the classical scholar,
and the graver acumen of the profound theologian;
which, added to the unaffected fervour of his piety,
the benevolence of his disposition, and the sterling
integrity of his general character, embalmed his memory
in the hearts of a large circle of friends, who deplore
his loss." He died at Wellingborough June 23rd, 1842,
and was interred in the burying ground belonging to
the Meeting. His most intimate friend, Mr. Walford,
of Uxbridge, who was classical tutor for some years at
Homerton College, officiated at the funeral; and Mr.
Toller, of Kettering, preached the funeral sermon the
next Sabbath evening, from Zech. i. 5: "Your fathers,
where are they? and the prophets, do they live for
ever?"</p>

<p>A tablet was erected by his widow to his memory,
and placed at the right side of the pulpit.</p>

<p>Mr. Robertson was secretary to the Northamptonshire
Association, from the death of Mr. Edwards, of Northampton,
until he was laid aside from active service.
He was a frequent contributor to the <i>Eclectic Review</i>,
and wrote many valuable articles of biblical criticism,
besides others of a more general character. His attainments
in learning were eminent; his intellectual
power was considerable&mdash;his general information extensive;
his skill in criticism was great; while he was
a man of inflexible integrity, pre-eminently "without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
guile"&mdash;a sincere and steadfast friend, with much kindness
of heart. His stern and unbending regard to
principle sometimes occasioned a roughness of exterior,
and occasionally appeared to assume an austere and
unkind aspect. Some of his sermons discovered talent
of a high order for composition, containing superior
thoughts, clothed in powerful language.</p>

<p>The following record we find respecting Mr. Robertson's
affliction, and the views entertained by the people
under it:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>In the month of January, 1838, it pleased God to visit with
a painful mental affliction the Rev. James Robertson, the
pastor of the Church, so as totally to disqualify him for conducting
the services of the sanctuary, or holding any intercourse
with the people of his charge. Several months after
the commencement of his illness, the pulpit was generously
supplied on Sabbath-day by neighbouring ministers. The
friends, however, at length deeply feeling their destitute condition,
and perceiving the congregation on the decline, were
led anxiously to deliberate on the course which a due concern
for their own spiritual improvement and the welfare of Zion
required them to take; at the same time keeping in view
their obligations to their honoured and afflicted pastor. After
frequent consultations among themselves and with various
ministers in the county, and much prayer, it was suggested,
that as no symptoms of returning health appeared, the connexion
ought to be dissolved. It was with great regret that
the friends perceived that such a proposal must come from
them, rather than from their pastor himself; but the state of
his mind being such as to unfit him for the transaction of
business, it became, on their part, a matter of necessity and
painful duty. Accordingly, in the month of September, 1838,
a letter to this effect, approved by the Church and congregation,
was addressed to Mrs. Robertson, after which other correspondence
took place, which it is unnecessary to detail, and
the relation terminated.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>In the beginning of the year 1839 the Rev. E. T.
Prust, of Northampton, introduced to the notice of the
friends the Rev. G. Taylor, who, in consequence of
severe indisposition, had been obliged to resign a previous
charge in the vicinity of Manchester, but whose
health was so far restored as to enable him to resume
his ministerial labours. He was accordingly invited
to preach for a few Sabbaths in the month of April.
At the expiration of this time, he was invited to the
pastoral office; which, after proper consideration and
advice, he accepted. A recognition service was held
on Thursday, October 24th, the order of which was
as follows:&mdash;"Reading and prayer, Rev. J. Renals;
questions, Rev. E. T. Prust; designation prayer, Rev.
T. Toller; address to Mr. Taylor, Rev. T. East,
founded on John xii. 26, last clause; address to the
people, Rev. J. Blackburn; concluding prayer, Rev.
R. Davis.</p>

<p>"In connexion with the above service, special united
meetings were held at the three Chapels in the town:
those for prayer, on Monday evening, Wednesday and
Thursday morning. On Tuesday evening, Rev. Thos.
Milner preached; on Wednesday evening, Rev. T.
East; and on Thursday evening there was a united
communion service. The whole of the services were
well attended, and great interest was excited."</p>

<p>After a short but active, affectionate, and faithful
ministerial course here, Mr. Taylor's health again began
to decline, which soon brought his labours in the
ministry to a final close. He was under the necessity of
resigning his office. His letter of resignation was dated
June 24th, 1845, having scarcely completed six years
of pastoral labour in this place. He died at Birmingham
in 1846, at forty-two years of age, in the faith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
and hope of the Gospel, leaving a widow and rising
family especially to mourn his loss.</p>

<p>Mr. Taylor was born in Birmingham, February 10th,
1804. His parents were eminent for their piety, and
his father was for many years a deacon of the Church
assembling in Ebenezer Chapel, under the pastoral
care of Mr. Timothy East. He received an excellent
classical education at the school of Mr. J. Hammond,
Independent minister, at Handsworth, of whom he
always spake with much respect. He was called in
early life to the knowledge of the truth, under the
powerful ministry of Mr. East. The grace which he
had received soon made him a decided Christian, and
pointed him out as one likely to be useful in public
service. His thoughts were soon directed to the work
of the ministry; he pursued a course of study at Highbury
College, where his attainments were respectable,
and where he gained the affectionate attachment of his
fellow students. His first situation as a pastor was at
New Windsor, near Manchester. Here he continued
until, after eight years' service, he was obliged by the
state of his health to resign his charge, and preached
his farewell sermon from the words of the Apostle, "I
would that ye knew what great conflict I have for
you," &amp;c., which was listened to with the deepest interest;
and many sorrowed, "that they should see his
face no more" as their beloved pastor. After an interval
of two years, his health appeared to be sufficiently
recovered for him to resume his stated labours,
and he then accepted the invitation to become the pastor
of this Church. Here he ministered with considerable
success for a short period, the Church and
congregation increasing; but the interest at first excited
was not sustained until the close of his ministry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
which might partly arise from the weakness of his
constitution rendering him incapable of the continued
mental and physical effort which the stated engagements
of the pastor for a series of years demand.
After about six years spent in this situation, symptoms
of decline appeared. He sought relief by spending
six months on the southern coast, but it proved in
vain; his disorder increased. It become necessary for
him to resign his second charge; and he retired to end
his days amongst his friends in his native town, where
he closed his course, in the possession of the peace and
hope of the Gospel. Mr. Taylor was amiable, honourable,
and affectionate; he had a strong principle of
piety towards God, a deep vein of devotional feeling, a
firm reliance on the merits of the Saviour. His great
aim was to be useful in the conversion of sinners and
advancing the kingdom of the Redeemer.</p>

<p>Some months after the death of Mr. Taylor, the
Rev. J. Watson, then tutor of Newport Pagnell Academy,
introduced to the notice of the Church the Rev.
J. F. Poulter, of Queen's College, Cambridge. When
Mr. Poulter had supplied the pulpit for some weeks with
acceptance, he was invited to take the pastoral charge,
which invitation he accepted, and was ordained Thursday,
December 17th, 1846, when the Rev. J. Watson,
of Newport, delivered the introductory discourse;
Rev. T. Toller proposed the questions; Rev. E. T.
Prust offered the ordination prayer; Rev. W. Forster,
of Kentish Town, delivered the charge.</p>

<p>Mr. Poulter is the present minister of this Church
and congregation. In the year 1850 new school-rooms
were erected, at the cost of rather more than 300.
The site was presented by Mr. W. Warren, and the
design given by Mr. E. Sharman. At the opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
services the Rev. H. Allom, of Union Chapel, Islington,
preached; Rev. Samuel Martin, of Westminster, in the
evening, from Proverbs xx. 11.</p>

<p>Mr. John Gibbs, of Wellingborough, who died May
19th, 1813, left by will the sum of 100 in the hands
of his executors, to be by them invested in the funds
or other good security, the interest of which is to be
paid annually on St. Thomas's-day, December 21st, to
the minister of this place, independent of the salary
paid him by the congregation.</p>


<h4> SECTION 2.&mdash;THE CHURCH AT WEST END.</h4>

<p>To be able to discover very distinctly the origin of
a Christian society of 160 years' standing, and from
thence to trace the varied events of its history, is
especially interesting to those minds that love to observe
how the great Head of the Church carries on
the affairs of his kingdom by the varied operations of
providence and of grace, employing the agency of his
servants, and showing the influence of Christian principle
in promoting his great designs.</p>

<p>If the reader will look back to the memorials of
the Church at Rowell, and will notice the itinerating
labours of Mr. Davis, the third pastor, with the success
that attended them, in connexion with the efforts of
some of the brethren in that Church, he will there
see how this Church at Wellingborough originated.
There were a considerable number of persons who
had derived benefit from the labours of Mr. Davis,
residing in Wellingborough and its vicinity, who had
become members of the Church at Rowell. After
some time, it was thought that their number was sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
to form a distinct Christian community, <i>i.e.</i>, an
Independent Church, with its officers. They received
a regular dismission from the Church at Rowell for
this purpose. The copy of that dismission we have
given in the account of that Church (page 57), from
which they were dismissed; and we find the same preserved
in the records of this Church&mdash;the one account
furnishing a complete corroboration of the other. The
first statement after this is&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>The 22nd day of the eighth month, 1691, was kept solemnly
in fasting and prayer at Wellingborough by us whose names
are hereafter written, for our embodying and enchurching
together; when, after that the former part of the day was spent
in prayer, direction, and exhortation, our dismission from the
Church of Christ at Rowell was then read by their messengers.</p></blockquote>

<p>After this it is recorded&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Having covenanted each apart, and then in the name of
Christ, in these words&mdash;"We do, in the presence of our Lord
Jesus Christ our crowned King, his holy angels, his people,
and all the people here present, give ourselves up to the Lord
and to one another by the will of God, joyfully promising and
engaging to walk with the Lord Jesus Christ and with his
people in the observation of all Gospel ordinances, and in the
discharge of all relative duties in the house of God, and as
the presence of the Lord shall enable us"&mdash;We lifted up our
hands thereunto, and afterwards subscribed our names.</p>

<p>We, having been dismissed from the Church of Christ which
we did belong to, and having given up ourselves to the Lord
and to one another by the will of God, and to this subscribed,
in the presence of many witnesses, as becomes a Church of the
Lord Jesus Christ, having all the power amongst ourselves to
manage all matters belonging to us as a Church of the Lord
Jesus.</p></blockquote>

<p>After this they proceed to choose two ruling elders,
who covenanted with the people in the presence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Lord to be faithful to the charges committed to them;
the Church also covenanted to carry it towards them
as a people to their officers. Then they chose Mr.
Bettson, who had been approved by the Church at
Rowell for the ministry of the word, to become their
pastor; and on an appointed day they proceed to
ordain him to this office, in a manner similar to that
which had been adopted by the Church of which they
had formerly made a part. They state&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>We proceeded to ordain our brother Bettson, in which our
elders brother Henseman and brother Osborn laid their hands
on brother Bettson and prayed, setting him before the Lord,
testifying to the Lord that that was the man they had chosen
to the office of a pastor; and after prayer, laid their hands
on him again, and declared to the people that he was their
pastor; and the ruling elders gave him authority, entering
into covenant with him as to right them in their transactions.
There were several pastors of other Churches present,
as Mr. Bear, Mr. Greenwood, Mr. Davis, besides brethren of
other Churches.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 14th day of the same month they say&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>We then agreed, and solemnly passed this as a Church
act, that we would not bear with any that were with us that
whispered against any of the brethren, or backbited any,
looking upon it as abusing that rule in the 18th chapter of
Matthew; also very dishonourable to the Lord Jesus, and injurious
to the Church; separating between chief friends, and
giving occasion to the enemies to blaspheme.</p></blockquote>

<p>The ministry of Mr. Bettson appears to have been
evangelical, earnest, and successful, so that 174 members
were added to the Church during his ministry,
which continued for 33 years. During the early
years of that ministry much comfort and usefulness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
is indicated; but the latter part of it appears to have
been attended with some heavy trials.</p>

<p>In the earliest part of their history they held numerous
Church-meetings; had members belonging to
the Church from many different places. Occasionally
they held Church-meetings at Olney, 12 miles from
Wellingborough, in which place and neighbourhood a
number of the members resided, until at length they
were formed into a Church in that place.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bettson," it is observed, "was a man possessed
of much prudence, piety, and perseverance.
His trials were many; for preceding the choice of an
assistant, another minister came to the town to preach
in opposition to Mr. Bettson. Many hearers left, and
the interest was greatly reduced."</p>

<p>From their Church records, it appears that they
performed the marriage ceremony among themselves.
The covenant of marriage is thus expressed:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>I, J. N., take thee, M. M., to be my wedded wife, and
solemnly promise, in the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ,
to be a loving, tender, and faithful husband, until death.</p>

<p>I, M. M., take thee, J. N., to be my wedded husband, and
solemnly promise, in the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ,
to be a loving, tender, faithful, and obedient wife, until death.</p></blockquote>

<p>"The date of the first certificate of marriage is
1692, and the date of the last that was given 1714."</p>

<blockquote><div class="signature">
<i>Wellingborough, 22nd day of the 10th month.</i>

<p>These are to certify all whom it may concern, that Samuel

<p>Preceding marriage, Mr. Bere received a note from the
place where the parties lived, according to the following
testimony:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"These are to certify all whom it may concern, of the banns
of matrimony between Brize, of the parish of Clifton, in the
county of Bucks, on the one part, and Ann Rollins, of this

<p>When a Christian society is in circumstances of
peculiar difficulty and discouragement, it is important
that their state should engage the sympathies and
draw forth the counsels of other Christian societies,
as a means of encouragement and assistance under the
struggles to which they are called. Acting on this
principle, this Church, under its trials, applied for
advice to other Churches, and received the following
letter from the Church at Rowell, expressive of their
sympathy and their counsels:</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Dear Brethren in the Lord</span>,&mdash;Our messengers, sent
upon your desire to assist you in your faults, informed us that
you wanted advice respecting your duty towards those members
who wilfully left their places amongst you, broke their
solemn covenant with you, and entered into a separate covenant
with excommunicated persons, to carry on a separate
cause with them. Our messengers further informed us of
the unanimous advice given by the messengers of several
Churches, that you should proceed against them as covenant-breakers;
making use of Christian endeavours, evangelical
admonitions, for their recovery, if the Lord pleases to bless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
to the same end; and in case of obstinacy to cut them off.
Of this advice we heartily approve as a Church of Christ; and
desire that the Spirit of the Lord may be with you in it, and
enable you to go comfortably through it, and give you success
in it. We pity you under your great and sore trials, and, as
helping you, prayed for you, that you may be filled with all
the fulness of God. We pity any who have been deluded
from their duty under specious pretences, and desire that the
God of all grace would give them speedily to renounce them.
However, the Lord give unto you (the weak handed) to be
found in the way of your duty, for therein is peace. Abstain
from your own wisdom; let your weapons be spiritual and
mighty through God, to whose care we remit you, and remain
your sympathizing brethren,</p>

<p>Sometimes a change in the ministry, when an interest
is brought into such a state that it can hardly stand its
ground, has a favourable effect; and may, under the
divine blessing, be the means of bringing about a
pleasing change. Thus it proved in the history of this
Church. Mr. Bettson's age increasing and energies
declining, they agreed to invite a co-pastor. A Mr.
Grant, another member of the Church at Rowell, was
chosen to this office. Finding his ministry acceptable,
they wrote to the Church at Rowell, requesting
his dismission to them, that he might be ordained as
joint pastor with Mr. Bettson. The Church granted
their desire, and in their letter of dismission we find
the following passages:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>It affecteth us greatly that the Lord seemeth to smile upon
his precious cause amongst you, so that we hope the night of
your affliction is far spent, and the day of much more abounding
joy and consolation is at hand. "Weeping endureth for
a night, but joy cometh in the morning."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>We are glad that any of our dear brethren and sisters, who
in the dark and cloudy day have been turned aside from their
duty, are brought to their covenanted places in the Church.
We have no reason to doubt but the Spirit of God will in a
gracious manner bring others. When He is pleased to plead,
who can resist? And we hope the same Spirit will enable
you to carry it in all meekness of wisdom toward them, leaving
the issue to God.</p>

<p>We bless God that the ministry of our beloved brother
William Grant has been made so useful amongst you, and
that the Spirit of God doth so fit it for edification and conversion.
We pray that such fruits may abound more and
more; and in order thereunto, upon your request and his
desire, the Church has ordered us, in their names, to sign his
dismission to your fellowship.</p>

<p>We should be very glad of the continuance of his fellowship
with us, and his labours amongst us; but seeing our
dear Lord calleth him to work amongst you, and inclineth his
heart thereto, we submit, and think it our duty to rejoice in
your mercy.</p></blockquote>

<p>In reference to the ordination of Mr. Grant, we are
informed that "letters were ordered to be written in the
name of the Church to the several Churches therein
named, for their messengers to come over and behold
our order, and assist us in the ordination of brother
William Grant." Thursday, September 21st, 1723,
was appointed for this purpose.</p>

<blockquote><p>This being the day set apart for brother William Grant's
ordination, the Church assembled for it, in order to carry on
the solemn work, which was conducted as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>After some time spent in prayer, the Church appointed
brother William Curtis to be their mouth to propose the matter
to the Church, and also to brother Grant. The matter
being proposed to the Church, they gave their consent, by
standing up and lifting up their hands; no objection being
made by any of them. By their mouth it was proposed to
brother William Grant, whether or no he did willingly give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
up himself to the Lord and his Church, to serve the Lord and
them in the work and office of a pastor; which call of God
and his people he testified that he willingly obeyed and accepted.
That being done, the messengers of the several
Churches then present, as a testimony of their joy and communion,
gave the right hands of fellowship. Then brother
Hanneswell prayed, and Mr. Maurice preached, and brother
Curtis concluded the meeting with prayer; and in the evening
brother Grant preached; and so we concluded the day.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Grant's ministry proved so acceptable, that it
soon became necessary to enlarge the Old Meeting,
which was done in the year 1726.</p>

<p>A circumstance which appears to have been rather
unusual in the life of a plain country pastor 120 years
ago, took place in the history of Mr. Grant, followed
by some interesting results. "On June 11th, 1732,
the Church gave consent for Mr. Grant to go to London."
This was probably his first visit to the metropolis.
What was the special occasion of such an important
step being taken does not appear; but it was
on this visit that it is supposed the following well-authenticated
events took place. "Mr. Grant was
introduced to the study of a learned brother, for whom
he was to preach. This and the other book was
pointed out as of great importance, and discovering
great erudition in the author. Mr. Grant said, 'Sir,
I have had no literary advantages; therefore such
works are lost to me.' 'I am very sorry, then, that
you are to preach to my people, who have always been
accustomed to such ministers as have had a very liberal
education. But, Mr. Grant, if you should be confused
in your sermon, I beg you will soon close the subject.'
Lady C&mdash;&mdash;, seeing Mr. Grant's homely dress, felt
much timidity about him, and no small aversion to
hear him: but at the close of the service Lady C&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>&mdash;
and the minister were ready to testify their approbation;
and from this time such was her Ladyship's partiality
to Mr. Grant, that he frequently went to London
in the week to preach a lecture, and returned for the
Sabbath; and her Ladyship often came to Wellingborough
to spend the Lord's-day."</p>

<p>From this time Mr. Grant had a happy change in
his temporal circumstances; for, connected with the
liberal aid of her Ladyship, another event took place
which terminated in his favour. One of his hearers
had 200 left her, but found great difficulty in obtaining
her right. Mr. Grant interfered, and obtained it
for her. Such was her gratitude, that she left him
100 at her death.</p>

<p>During the first part of Mr. Grant's ministry at Wellingborough,
he had to struggle with great pecuniary
difficulties; but he now found true what a poor woman
said to him on first coming to Wellingborough&mdash;"Mr.
Grant, I wonder what induced you to come to such a
reduced and poor people; how do you think you can
be supported?" Then, as the effect of an instantaneous
impression, she said, "The Lord says, 'The silver
and the gold is mine'; and you, sir, shall have your
share." Mr. Grant was in very good circumstances at
the close of his life.</p>

<p>In 1734 they determined to build a new Meeting
House. They counted the cost of such a building,
erected in a plain manner, as they thought would then
comfortably contain their congregation, and found it
to be about 200. They built the walls, and put up
part of the roof; but found themselves, being still poor
and weak, under the necessity of asking the assistance
of friends. This was obtained, so that the whole expense
was shortly cleared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Grant's ministry extended over the lengthened
period of forty-eight years, during which 259 members
were added to the Church. It was on September 9th,
1770, that he preached for the last time, being very
ill, and for some time before this having been carried
to the pulpit. On March 22nd, 1771, after a long and
painful illness, borne with Christian patience and fortitude,
Mr. Grant's death took place, closing a devoted
and successful ministry.</p>

<p>It is observed, that "Mr. Grant was very lively in
the pulpit. His work appeared so much like the work
of heaven, that it often very much surprised his hearers."
"His charity was such, that he would deprive
himself of some comforts for the benefit of the poor."
A friend said to him, "I wonder, Mr. Grant, that you
do not keep a better fire this cold weather." He replied,
"other people want fires as well as myself." He
was a firm Dissenter, and had a great aversion to all
saints' days, &amp;c. His people frequently pressed him to
preach on Christmas-day: at last he complied with
reluctancy, and chose these words&mdash;"Ye are of your
father the devil, and his works will ye do."</p>

<p>When the dreadful fire took place at Wellingborough
in 1738, such was the distress of the inhabitants that
party names were forgotten; and the town requested
the Rev. Mr. Grant and the Rev. Mr. Homes, the
clergyman, to combine in collecting for the poor sufferers.
When Mr. Homes saw the great influence that
Mr. Grant had, and the unlimited respect paid to
him, he determined he would go with nobody else, even
on this charitable occasion. Mr. Homes retained
a great respect for him to the close of his days, and
would frequently say, "He was an honest and great
man."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>In the closing years of his life, Mr. Grant was deprived
of sight. An aged woman came to him on one
occasion, when two of his friends were leading him to
the pulpit, and said, "Sir, how do you do? for I cannot
see you." He rejoined, "nor can I see you; but let us
rejoice: there will be no blind people in heaven."</p>

<p>The following outline of a sermon is preserved from
one of Mr. Grant's manuscripts (Psalm lxxix. 8).
After a long introduction, he gives the following divisions:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>I. That God, as he is the God of Zion and the God of his
Church, does sometimes remember against his own people their
former iniquities, or the Church was mistaken here. "Oh,
remember not against us," said they, "our former iniquities."
Either God did remember against the Church their former
iniquities, or I say the Church was mistaken; for the Church
apprehends it so by her prayer. At this time she very plainly
believes God did remember against her her former iniquities,
and was now dealing with her by laying his rod upon
her; therefore under it she cries, "Remember not against us
our former iniquities; let thy tender mercies speedily prevent
us, for we are brought very low."</p>

<p>II. When a professing people, or particular persons, are
under chastisements and the severe rebukes of their God, to
plead his tender mercies is the best argument. "Let thy
tender mercies," says the Church, "speedily prevent us;" that
is, prevent our ruin, or we should be destroyed&mdash;we should be
brought to nothing as a Church if thou sufferest the enemy
to go forward in destroying them that are useful, cutting
them off as they have done in times past, and the bodies of the
saints should be still continued to be given as meat to the
beasts of the field and to the fowls of heaven, as in verse 2&mdash;then
we should be brought to ruin: but, "Oh let thy," &amp;c.</p>

<p>III. We see from the words of our text, that the people of
God may plead in their petitions their low estates for God's
help; this may come in by way of petition in prayer. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
miseries and God's mercies are very proper pleas at the throne
of grace. The poor publican made use of both in his prayer:
"God be merciful to me a sinner."</p>

<p>IV. Something by way of use, as (1.) Does God remember
the sins of his people by way of chastisement? Let us take
heed how we sin against him. (2.) Learn from hence, when
God is chastising you, and laying his rod upon you, to turn
to him that smites you, when he calls you by his rebukes.
Many turn from God. (3.) We learn from hence, as the
Church prays that God would not remember against her
former iniquities, so we should do.</p></blockquote>

<p>The following letter is inserted because it presents
some pleasing indications of the spirit that prevailed
in Mr. Grant and his people.</p>

<blockquote><div class="hanging">The Church of Christ at Wellingborough, under the pastoral
care of William Grant, to those Christian brethren and
sisters who have lately asked their dismission from the
Church of Christ at Lutterworth, under the pastoral care
of John Dowley, sendeth greeting, wishing grace and
peace, &amp;c.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Brethren</span>,&mdash;We, seeking the glory of our dear Lord
Jesus, and the peace and prosperity of his cause in general,
have been willing to concern ourselves in your affair so far
as to seek the Lord about it, and then to weigh and consider
well the case, which we have now done at no less than four
sundry times; and our conclusion is, that we cannot receive
you upon such a dismission: for, instead of a recommendation,
you have an accusation, that you could not come to
a temper; and then a conclusion, that your separation is
groundless. How far this accusation and conclusion are just
we cannot be proper judges, who live at so great a distance,
and have no opportunity of conversing with the members of
the Church, that so we might thoroughly know both sides;
for, until then, we cannot see how we can judge righteously
in the affair.</p>

<p>All that we can further do in the case is, to mourn over it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
before the Lord. The breaches and hurts of Zion are many.
Oh (have we not all reason to cry) that the Lord would arise
in his glory, and build up her walls, and heal all her breaches!
We earnestly desire that the Lord may appear for his cause
in Lutterworth, that you may have Christ's Gospel and his
law powerfully and plainly preached amongst you, that all
that fear God in those parts may unitedly feed together in
the ways of the Lord, and your children may be converted,
and the seed of strangers also. Thus we subscribe ourselves
your brethren in the best bonds.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The original letter, in the handwriting of Mr. Grant,
is in the possession of T. Grundy, Esq., Northampton.</p>

<p>When Mr. Grant's infirmities greatly increased, both
he and his people were anxious to obtain an assistant
before his departure. Prayer was presented fervently
on this behalf, that they might have a pastor come
after God's own heart. The fears of the people were
great, on account of their attachment to the ministry
of Mr. Grant, that no one would be so acceptable as to
keep them together; as they considered few so acceptable
in the pulpit as Mr. Grant. After several disappointments
in probationers for the office, there remained
this ground of hope&mdash;unity of spirit and prayer were
given and continued.</p>

<p>After a time they received information of Mr. John
Carver, who was pastor of a small Church in the village
of Kirtling, Cambridgeshire, as one that was very likely
to suit them. He came and preached to them two
Sabbaths. General satisfaction prevailed in the Church
and congregation; without one dissenting voice they
desired him to come and remain among them. Mr.
Carver accepted their call, and removed with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
family to Wellingborough, October 30th, 1770. The
ordination took place June 20th in the following year,
which appears to have been conducted according to the
more general practice of the Churches. Mr. Smith,
of Oundle, read the hymns; Mr. Hayton began in
prayer; Mr. Bond, of Toft, delivered the introductory
discourse, and asked the usual questions; Mr. Simmons,
of Bedford, gave the exhortation to the people, from
Col. ii. 5, 6; Mr. Ashpiner, of Poole, in Dorset,
prayed; Mr. Gregson, of Rowell, gave the charge,
from Rom. i. 16; Mr. Walker, of Olney, concluded
the service. "And, blessed be the Lord!" it is added,
"it was a very solemn day. Every part of it was conducted
with great order and satisfaction."</p>

<p>Then we have the covenant of the Church renewed;
and another covenant after revolt, partly given in the
following terms:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>We, the members of the Church of the living God assembling
at Wellingborough, having greatly revolted from our
dear Lord, in a deep sense of both former and later miscarriages
against his love, blood, honour, crown, and dignity, as
King of Souls and Churches, &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>This seems to be imperfect, as it breaks off abruptly
here.</p>

<p>During Mr. Carver's ministry, we find three who
became members of the Church, that afterwards became
pastors of Christian societies&mdash;viz.: Mr. Perry,
the first pastor of the Church at Wollaston; Mr.
Hennell, its second pastor; and Mr. Hillyard, the first
pastor of the Church at Brigstock, and afterwards for
many years minister at Olney.</p>

<p>In the year 1791 the present Meeting House was
built. We are informed "that there was much conversation
previously on the subject; and at length the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
congregation agreed to do it, if the expense could be
defrayed among themselves, without dependence on
others." This was a noble spirit. A subscription
was opened among them, and found to be of sufficient
amount to warrant their proceeding in the business.
While the building was going forward they conducted
a part of their service in Cheese Lane Meeting, by the
kind permission of the stated congregation there. On
the 11th of September, 1791, they met for the first
time in their new place of worship. "The satisfaction
arising from having a commodious large place of worship
for ourselves and our posterity, without assistance
from anyone, was great indeed."</p>

<p>The following account of Mr. Carver's life, character,
and ministry, was drawn up by the late Mr. Bull, of
Newport, the friend of Newton and Cowper.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Rev. John Carver was born <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1733, at Southill, in
Bedfordshire, and was several years a member of the Independent
Church in that place, of which Church his father
was a deacon. That piety and those talents which shone
with increasing lustre to the close of his life, discovered themselves
at a very early period; but unaffected modesty and
conscientious motives prevented his entering into the ministry
till he had completed his thirtieth year. He began by
privately exercising his gifts before the Church, and afterwards
established an evening lecture among his poor neighbours,
to whom he preached after the labours of the day were
closed. He continued these exercises, and some occasional
services, a considerable time before he relinquished his secular
employment and devoted himself entirely to the service of
the Church. At length, however, he accepted the unanimous
and urgent invitation of a small but affectionate congregation
at Kirtling, near Newmarket, in Cambridgeshire. With this
people he remained until his removal to Wellingborough,
where he continued his ministry with great respectability and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
usefulness near twenty-seven years, his life and his labours
ending on January 31st, 1797.</p>

<p>Mr. Carver had not the advantage of an academical education;
but his understanding, naturally vigorous, was cultivated
by reading and reflection. In conversation he was
habitually serious without gloom, and cheerful without levity.
He possessed to an uncommon degree the happy talent of
giving a devotional turn to almost every subject. Far from
assuming any consequential airs, he alone seemed insensible
to what every one else perceived, that he was the life and
soul of the company. While the advanced Christian felt
himself edified by the depth and solidity of his remarks,
the young, to whom he paid a particular attention, were
charmed by his affectionate address, the simplicity of his
language, and the aptness of his illustrations.</p></blockquote>

<p>Though he did not pretend to an acquaintance with
the original languages, his biblical knowledge was
truly respectable. A sound judgment, a correct taste,
and extraordinary diligence in reading and studying the
word of God, joined with a proper use of our best commentators,
enabled him to appear to great advantage
as an interpreter of Scripture.</p>

<blockquote><p>In preaching, he never addressed the passions, but in subservience
to reason and truth. In explaining and defending
the doctrines and precepts of Christianity he was calm, perspicuous,
and often very ingenious. He was a firm but not
dogmatizing advocate for the sentiments usually styled Calvinistical.
In the practical and applicatory parts of his discourse
he was peculiarly striking. His numerous hearers
will doubtless long remember with what solemnity of voice
and manner, with what pointed energy of expression, he
warned the young, the thoughtless, and the dissipated; with
how much skill and tenderness he administered the consolations
of the Gospel to those who laboured under spiritual
discouragements. On these occasions, not only his voice and
gesture, but his countenance, and not unfrequently his tears,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
expressed the interest he felt in their eternal welfare. He
greatly excelled in prayer. Often was his large congregation
visibly affected by the seriousness and importunity of his addresses
at a throne of grace.</p>

<p>In private life he was truly exemplary. As a husband and
a father, his prudence, gentleness, and love, the evenness of
his temper and regularity of his conduct, commanded the
veneration and promoted the happiness of his family. Under
the pressure of great, not to say unparalleled afflictions,
he was resigned; when troubles came in upon him as a
mighty flood, his heart was still fixed, trusting in the Lord.
Those who have witnessed his deportment on the most trying
occasions have confessed their astonishment, and felt themselves
constrained to say, "Verily this is the Lord's doing,
and marvellous in our eyes."</p>

<p>One part of his character we must not omit. He was an
eminently peaceable man. To obtain and preserve peace he
would sacrifice everything, a good conscience only excepted.
The happy fruits of this disposition, and the beneficial effects
of such an example, will, we trust, continue to be enjoyed
many years by those who have had opportunity of observing
his great anxiety and unwearied exertions for the sake of
peace.</p>

<p>In his last illness, though his disorder was of a very painful
and distressing nature, yet neither the extremity of his sufferings
on the one hand, nor their long continuance on the
other, did ever extort from his lips a single expression of impatience
or distrust. His understanding was unimpaired and
his faith unshaken to the last moment; and he expired in
the act of repeating that triumphant song, "O death! where
is thy sting? O grave! where is thy victory?"</p></blockquote>

<p>After the death of Mr. Carver, the congregation was
unsettled for some time, and was dependent on supplies
through the next two or three years. At length
Mr. Bell was invited to become their pastor. But his
ministry proved of short continuance. It is said,
"that he was possessed of good talents; but was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
high in doctrine, denied the Gospel call to sinners as
sinners&mdash;that he manifested too great a degree of
levity, having much jocular wit." "He came to Wellingborough
like a burning light, and went out like a
candle in the estimation of many. There were, most
probably, faults on both sides; but some sad effects
resulted, it is considered, from his sentiments and his
levity." He continued only two or three years.</p>

<p>Mr. Renals was the next pastor of this Church. His
ordination took place January 7, 1804. On that occasion,
"Mr. Hennell, of Wollaston, formerly a deacon
of the Church, engaged in supplicating the divine
presence and blessing; Mr. Whitehead, of Creaton,
delivered the introductory discourse, asked the usual
questions, and received Mr. Renals' confession of
faith; Mr. Bull, of Newport, offered up the ordination
prayer, with imposition of hands; the charge succeeded,
by Mr. Grundy, of Lutterworth, from I Tim. iv. 6;
Mr. Gill, of Harborough, addressed the people, from
Phil. ii. 29; Mr. Washbourn, fellow labourer with
Mr. Renals in the same town, concluded with prayer.</p>

<p>The congregation assembled again in the evening,
when, after prayer by Mr. Hillyard, of Bedford, Mr.
Toller, of Kettering, preached from Psalm xxii. 30,
and Mr. Phillips, of Chedworth, Gloucestershire, closed
the service with prayer." In connexion with this account
it is stated, "that a very large concourse of
people, and thirty ministers, were the agreeable witnesses
of this important and happy settlement; and it
is with the sincerest pleasure we add, that the most
complete union subsists between both the Independent
ministers of this town, and that the spirit of brotherly
love prevails among the people. May it be perpetual!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Renals' ministry extended over 43 years in this
situation, so that he was one of a remarkable list of
four pastors of this Church, whose united services here
make up 150 years. During the pastorate of Mr.
Renals, 113 members were added to the Church; he
resigned his charge in the year 1847.</p>

<p>Numerous changes had taken place in the congregation
during Mr. Renals' labours among them; there was
a considerable decline in the number of hearers in many
of the latter years of his ministry, and the Church became
reduced to thirty members; this would be partly
owing to another Independent Church being formed in
the town, and partly to unpleasant circumstances that
arose among them. But Mr. Renals had some sincere
and attached friends to the close of his life. He was
born in the village of Rempstone, in Nottinghamshire,
April, 1769. His mother was a pious woman of the
Baptist persuasion, from whose counsels and prayers
he derived spiritual advantage. When he arrived at
mature age, he resided some time in Leicester, where
he frequently heard and much admired that eminent
clergyman, the Rev. Thomas Robinson, of St. Mary's,
well known for his clear evangelical views, and for the
zealous and devoted manner in which he preached the
Gospel in that town for many years. Mr. Renals afterwards
settling in Nottingham, became a member of
the Church at Castle Gate Meeting, then under the
pastoral care of the Rev. Richard Alliott, by whom he
was introduced to Rotherham College, which he entered
in the autumn of 1798. Being then nearly thirty years
of age, and not having had the advantages of preparatory
training, the tutors wisely deviated from their
usual course, and directed his attention chiefly to theological
studies. He first preached for a time at Hinchley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
in Leicestershire, going thither in 1802, but removed
to Wellingborough in the closing part of the
next year. He had a vigorous constitution; preached
three times every Lord's-day; was a warm advocate
for maintaining the afternoon service, in opposition to
the modern plan of morning and evening only. He
frequently preached on a week evening, in some of the
villages in the vicinity of Wellingborough. He was a
man of genuine piety, decided attachment to the principles
of the Gospel, sterling integrity, and considerable
activity. If his mind was not strictly logical, his
spirit was devotional; if his temper was not always
amiable, his heart was sincere; if prudence did not
guide in every effort, the aim, we believe, was always
upright; if there was not excessive candour, there was
much genuine kindness. Advancing years presented a
softening, meliorating, ripening influence. He would
labour in the cause of God, until entirely prevented
by his last affliction. While he cordially welcomed
his successor in the ministry, and offered a fervent
prayer at his ordination for him and for the people over
whom he had so long presided, "he continued preaching
most Sabbaths at the village of Finedon, whither
he was preparing to go when his last affliction compelled
him to desist and relinquish the attempt." After
a few weeks of considerable suffering, borne with
exemplary patience and fortitude, enjoying perfect
peace and a hope full of immortality, he died, being
nearly 80 years of age.</p>

<p>Mr. Cornelius Curtis Tyte, from the academy of
Rotherham, was unanimously invited as successor to
Mr. Renals. He was ordained in October, 1847, when
Mr. Bellamy, of Sheffield, now of Buckingham, delivered
the introductory discourse; Mr. Renals offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the ordination prayer; and Dr. Stowell, Mr. Tyte's
tutor, delivered the charge, from Col. iv. 17. In the
evening, Mr. Toller, of Kettering, preached to the
people from Acts ii. 42. Since this time 21 members
have been added to the Church. The present number
of communicants is 37. There are 100 children in
the Sabbath-schools; in actual attendance, between 80
and 90.</p>

<p>Occasional services are conducted in one village in
the vicinity of Wellingborough, the village of Finedon.
The happy union of the present pastor and his people,
and the harmony that subsists between them and the
other ministers and congregations generally in the
town, present, we trust, a cheering prospect for the
future, that "walking in the fear of the Lord, and in
the comfort of the Holy Ghost, they may be greatly
edified and multiplied."</p>


<h4>SECTION 3.&mdash;THE CHURCH AT SALEM CHAPEL.</h4>

<p>The Independent Church at Salem Chapel, Wellingborough,
was originally formed by those who separated
from the Church at Cheese Lane Meeting, in the same
town, in the year 1812. However much this separation
might be regretted at the time, after the lapse of
forty years it would be unwise to attempt to enter into
the grounds of that separation. The unpleasant feelings
at first produced have, we trust, long ere this
entirely subsided, and the pastors and the people
can now go forward in harmonious co-operation for
the promotion of the same great cause to which they
are devoted.</p>

<p>It was on the evening of the Lord's-day, September<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
21st, 1812, that the Church was formed here, in the
presence of the Rev. Joseph Whitehead, of Creaton,
and the Rev. Shadrach Jackson, of Old. They united
in a Church covenant, which they have thus expressed:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>We hope that by grace we have been brought to see our
last state and condition; to behold the remedy prepared in
the Gospel, Christ Jesus the Lord; to flee to him as such; to
put our trust in him for life and salvation: and we do hereby
resign up ourselves to Christ, in Church fellowship and communion,
resolving and promising in his strength to devote
ourselves entirely to him; to believe his promises, live by
faith upon them, obey his precepts, hearken to the voice of
his providence, and serve him according to all the laws,
statutes, and ordinances of his house; taking the written
word for our rule, and aiming at the glory of God in all
things.</p>

<p>We do further covenant and agree to walk together in
Christian fellowship; regularly and constantly to attend all
the ordinances of God's house; and that we will watch over
one another in love, seeking each other's happiness and welfare,
by sympathizing with the afflicted, comforting the
mourner, strengthening the weak, confirming the wavering,
reclaiming the backslider, and by every possible means do all
that we can to promote each other's peace, comfort, and edification
in Christ Jesus our Lord; while we study the peace
and prosperity of the whole Church, that God may be in the
midst of her, and abundantly bless her.</p>

<p>Thus Christians of old "first gave up themselves to the
Lord, and then to each other by the will of God."</p></blockquote>

<p>The first pastor of the Church was the Rev. Pollard
Davis, whose ordination took place June 1st, 1813,
when we find Mr. Gill, of Harborough, Mr. Whitehead,
of Creaton, Mr. Bull, of Newport, Mr. Fuller,
of Kettering, Mr. Chater, of Kibworth, engaged in the
services of the day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Davis's ministry continued until January 24th,
1821, when he resigned his charge. He appears to
have admitted 23 members to the Church.</p>

<p>Rev. C. T. Sevier was the next pastor, who entered
on his charge in the year 1822, and continued for
about 12 years, removing from Wellingborough in
the year 1834.</p>

<p>Rev. J. Bevan was the immediate successor of Mr.
Sevier, entering on his pastoral labours September
20th, 1835. The ministry of Mr. Bevan was of short
continuance at Wellingborough; receiving an invitation
to become the pastor of a Church at Liverpool,
he soon resigned his charge here. He was succeeded
by the Rev. Robert Davis, who, having received a
unanimous invitation to become their pastor, entered
on his stated services February 18th, 1838. The
number of members in the Church when Mr. Davis
became pastor appears to have been 79, and at the
close of his ministry they numbered 107. Mr. Davis
removed from Wellingborough to Turvey, in Bedfordshire.</p>

<p>In July, 1846, the present minister, the Rev. Thomas
Thomas, who was educated at Homerton College, after
supplying the congregation about six months, was ordained
to the pastoral office. On that occasion, the
Rev. J. A. Morris, of London, delivered the introductory
discourse; Mr. Toller, of Kettering, offered
the ordination prayer; Dr. Pye Smith (Mr. Thomas's
tutor) delivered the charge; Mr. Robinson, of Kettering,
preached to the people. The attendance was
large, and the services of an interesting character.</p>

<p>Since Mr. Thomas commenced his ministry, new
school-rooms have been erected for the accommodation
of the Sabbath-schools. The cost of them was 300.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
They were opened on Tuesday, September 18th, 1849,
when the Rev. Dr. Reed, of London, and the Rev.
J. Toller, of Kettering, preached. There are 184
children in the Sabbath-schools. The present number
of communicants is 100.</p>

<p>The villages supplied with regular services in the
vicinity of Wellingborough are Doddington and Wilby,
and occasionally Orlingbury. As this Church is
of comparatively recent formation, and as all those
that have sustained the pastoral office over it are, we
believe, still living, the account we can present is
necessarily short.</p>

<p>The present pastor and his flock will rejoice in the
tokens of divine favour they have received; and will
go forward, we trust, with the cheering hope of continued
and yet more abundant supplies of divine
blessings, so that peace and prosperity may now be
increasingly and permanently experienced in this department
of Zion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>MEMORIALS OF THE INDEPENDENT CHURCH AT
OUNDLE.</h3>


<p>In attempting to trace the principles of Nonconformity
to their earliest manifestations in the town of
Oundle, after the reformation from Popery, we find
two Puritan divines ministering here in the course of
the sixteenth century. These were men who could
not conform to all the rites and ceremonies of the
Church as by law established, and who had to suffer
much for their refusal to comply with its requirements.</p>

<p>The first of these was Eusebius Paget, who was
born at Cranford, in this county, and educated in
Christ's College, Oxford. During his abode at Oxford
he broke his right arm, and was lame of it ever after.
When he removed from the University he became
vicar of Oundle and rector of Langton, but was exceedingly
harassed on account of his Nonconformity.</p>

<p>On January 29th, 1573, he was cited by Scambler,
Bishop of Peterborough, who first suspended him for
three weeks, and then deprived him of his living,
worth 100 per annum. Several others were suspended
and deprived at the same time, because they
could not with a good conscience subscribe to certain
promises and engagements proposed to them by the
Bishop. And this Dr. Edward Scambler, successively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Bishop of Peterborough and Norwich, was the first
pastor of a Protestant congregation in London in the
reign of Queen Mary; but was compelled, on account
of the severity of the persecution, to relinquish the
situation. He was a learned man; very zealous against
the Papists; and was probably driven into a state of
exile. But surely he forgot his former circumstances,
when he became a zealous persecutor of his brethren
in the days of Elizabeth; not remembering that they
were as conscientious in their objections to what they
considered to be the remains of Popery in a reformed
Church, and in their endeavours to obtain a purer
mode of discipline and worship, as he had been in his
efforts against what he formerly disapproved. After
this Mr. Paget was preferred to the rectory of Kilkhampton,
in Cornwall.</p>

<p>When Mr. Paget and his brethren were deprived,
they presented a supplication to the Queen and the
Parliament for their restoration to their beloved ministry,
but to no purpose; they must subscribe, or be
buried in silence.</p>

<p>Further suffering awaited Mr. Paget: his unfeeling
persecutors, not content with cutting him off from his
ministry and his living, ordered him to be taken into
custody and sent up to London. He was therefore
apprehended, with Mr. John Oxenbridge, another leading
person in the Association in Northamptonshire and
Warwickshire, and they were both carried prisoners
to the metropolis, by an order from Archbishop Grindal.
It does not however appear how long they were kept
in custody, nor what further persecution they suffered.
Mr. Paget filled different situations in the ministry
afterwards, and was repeatedly subjected to ecclesiastical
censures. He died in London, May, 1617.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Wood says of him, "He was many years a constant
and faithful preacher of God's word"; and Fuller
styles him "a golden sophister, a painful preacher,
and author of an excellent history of the Bible." He
had a son, Ephraim Paget, who was born in Northamptonshire,
probably at Oundle, in 1575, who became
a Puritan minister.</p>

<p>It was probably not very long after Mr. Paget was
thus driven from Oundle, that Hugh Clark, A.M. was
settled in the ministry here. He was born at Burton-upon-Trent,
August 15th, 1563, and educated first in
Jesus College, Cambridge, then in the University of
Oxford. It is stated, "that when he came to Oundle
he found the people in a state of the most deplorable
ignorance and profaneness, living in the constant profanation
of the Lord's-day by Whitsun ales, morris-dancing,
and other ungodly sports. For a considerable
time he laboured to convince them of their sins and to
reclaim them from their evil ways, but without any
prospect of success. Though God visited several of
the ringleaders by successive remarkable judgments,
they still persisted in their profane sports. They seem
to have made a covenant with death, and to have been
at agreement with hell. At length, however, there
was a pleasing alteration. They began to take serious
heed to the ministry of the word; their lives became
reformed, and many were called to a saving knowledge
of the Gospel."</p>

<p>During Mr. Clark's abode in this place he experienced
several remarkable providential deliverances,
among which was the following: Having in his 'Sermon
on the Sabbath-day' announced the just judgment
of God against certain particular sins to which the
young people were much addicted, the next morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
a lusty young man came to his house wishing to see
him. Mr. Clark, having invited him into his chamber,
and knowing his vicious character, sharply reproved
him, and warned him of his awful danger; and God
wrought so effectually upon his heart by this pointed
and faithful dealing, that the man, falling down on his
knees and crying for pardon, pulled out a dagger, by
which he had determined to murder him. "I came
hither," said the man, "with a full resolution to stab
you; but God has prevented me. This was occasioned
by your terrifying sermon yesterday; but if you please
to forgive me, I shall never attempt any such thing
again." Mr. Clark freely pardoned the offence, and
after giving him suitable advice, dismissed him.</p>

<p>In the year 1590 Mr. Clarke removed from Oundle
to Wollaston, in Warwickshire, where he was chosen
to the pastoral office by the people, and received the
presentation to the living from Sir Roger Wigston.
He was once indicted for high treason, because he had
prayed that "God would forgive the Queen her sins";
but was acquitted. He was a constant, zealous, and
laborious preacher, a person of great learning and
piety, useful in his ministry, and an acute and powerful
disputant. His death occurred November 6th,
1634, in the 72nd year of his age. Three of his descendants
were numbered amongst the ejected ministers
in the year 1662.</p>

<p>At the time of the restoration of Charles II., it appears
that Mr. Richard Resbury was vicar of Oundle,
and that he became one of the Nonconformist ministers,
resigning his living six weeks before Bartholomew-day.
Here he afterwards preached in his own hired house,
practised medicine with some success, and was advised
with by persons of all ranks. We are informed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
he was a man of brisk parts, and very facetious; but
had the general reputation of a solid divine, and made
a considerable figure in this county. He was particularly
honoured for what he wrote in opposition to
Mr. John Goodwin, on the Arminian controversy.
In addition to what he published on this subject, he
wrote 'The Tabernacle of God with Man; or, the
visible Church Reformed: A Discourse of the Nature
and Discipline of the visible Church.'</p>

<p>Robert Wild, D.D., who was ejected from the living
of Ayno, in this county, after his ejectment came to
reside at Oundle. He was a native of St. Ives, in
Huntingdonshire; educated at St. John's College,
Cambridge. He published 'The Arraignment of a
Sinner at the Bar of Divine Justice: an Assize Sermon,
preached at Oxford, 1655, and dedicated to John
Cartwright, Esq., of Ayno.' Several other works appeared
as the production of his pen. He was noted
for his facetiousness, but was very serious in serious
things. As an illustration of this, it is related that
Mr. Job Orton received the following statement from
an ancient Christian in Northamptonshire:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Mr. Baxter, being much displeased at some instances of
his facetiousness which he had heard of, called on him, in his
way from Kidderminster to London, to reprove him, as the
times were very dark; and he appears to have thought that
there was something especially unsuitable in this to such days
of trial. When he came to Ayno, he found the Doctor just
gone to Church, it being observed by him and his people as a
fast-day. Mr. Baxter goes to the Church, seats himself in one
corner, and becomes so deeply interested, and so well satisfied,
that when the service was over he came to the Doctor, thanked
him for his service, and desired that he would reprove and
rebuke him sharply, as he deserved it. Being desired to explain
himself, Mr. Baxter said, "for my great uncharitableness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
and folly in regarding reports," &amp;c.; and then told him why
he had called upon him.</p></blockquote>

<p>After Dr. Wild came to reside at Oundle, it pleased
God to visit Mr. Resbury, the ejected vicar, with the
palsy; and the Doctor wrote letters to all parts of the
country in order to raise him some money to take him
to Bath, for his relief. A Mr. Stancliff wrote of him,
"that he was excellently qualified unto his ministerial
work; none more melted and melting in prayer, nor
more serious and fervent in preaching Christ and his
Gospel." He died at Oundle, in the year 1679. A
little before his death he preached on Rev. xiv. 12:
"Here are they that keep the commandments of God,
and the faith of Jesus;" when he said, "it is but a
short time, and I shall be in paradise."</p>

<p>There was also in these days a Mr. Strickland
Negus, ejected from Chester, in this county, who was
one of the Thursday lecturers at Oundle. It appears
to have been the custom of the Puritan ministers of
this county, while in the Church, to have week-day
lectures preached at their different churches by their
brethren alternately. Of Mr. Negus it is said, that
"he was a truly good man, and a useful preacher."</p>

<p>Mr. Edward Cauthorn, ejected from Tansover, was
one of the lecturers at Oundle, where he had a good
estate, and whither he came to reside after his ejectment;
and here he died in 1665 or 1666. "He was a
man of great meekness, and a very able preacher."</p>

<p>Whether these Nonconformist ministers went so far
as to form a Church here on Congregational principles,
we are not informed; but their example and their services
appear to have been the means of a regular congregation
being gathered in these early days of Nonconformity;
and probably the spirit of persecution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
might not now discover itself so much here as in some
other parts of the country, which might be one reason
why several of those who were cast out of the Church
resorted to this place.</p>

<p>That there was a stated congregation, and probably
a Church formed, appears to be manifest by the next
fact in relation to these things that we find recorded;
which is, that Mr. Shepherd, who had been minister
at Tillbrook, in Bedfordshire, on quitting his living a
few years after the passing of the Act of Uniformity,
became pastor to a Dissenting congregation at Oundle.
This is the minister of whom it is stated, in our account
of the Church at Kettering, "that he had the true
spirit of his office, his preaching being very awful and
affecting, and his life very holy." About 1697 he removed
to Kettering, where, a few months after, he
died.</p>

<p>There is a tradition generally credited in Oundle,
that the Meeting House was built immediately after
the passing of "the Toleration Act," in 1790 or 1791.
The founder was Joseph Hewson, a draper in the
town, who erected the building on his own freehold,
for the use of himself and other Nonconformists
in the neighbourhood, who, as in other places, were but
too happy to emerge from the state of depression into
which they had been cast, to a state of comparative
liberty: but in 1724, David Hewson, of Market Harborough,
also a draper, son and heir of the founder,
sold the property to the society for the nominal sum of
40; and in the month of August, the same year, the
first trust deed was made, settling the building for ever
as a place of religious worship, and conveying the fee
of the freehold to twelve trustees. It was in the deed
denominated a place for a Presbyterian congregation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
but now the Church is formed on the principles of the
Independents. After Mr. Shepherd's removal from
Oundle, there appears to have been a Mr. Atkinson
pastor of the Church, for on the sacramental cups is
this inscription: "The Rev. Mr. Atkinson being our
present pastor, 1713."</p>

<p>The next pastor was Mr. Joseph King, who probably
might be first assistant and afterwards successor
to Mr. Atkinson, as there were three of Mr. King's
children buried in Oundle Churchyard, the first in
1712, the other two in 1714. Mr. King died in 1720.
A tombstone was erected to his memory in the Churchyard,
on which is a Latin inscription. The following
is a translation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<span class="smcap">Joseph King</span> died 29th Jany.,<br />
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1719/20, aged 46.<br />

</div>

<p>Mr. King was the father of Mr. Samuel King, who
was minister at Welford for forty years. This son was
born in 1815, and was little more than four years of
age when his father died. He was regarded as given
in answer to maternal prayer; for his mother, Mrs.
Hannah King, a woman of a devoted spirit, earnestly
desired to have a son that might become a minister of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
the Gospel. She long survived her husband; lived to
realize her highest desire on this behalf; and had the
happiness of closing her days, in a good old age, in the
house of her son, when he was minister of the Independent
Church at Welford. On an upright stone in
the Churchyard of that village there is the following
inscription, probably expressive of the affectionate remembrance
of her son:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
In memory of Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hannah King</span>, relict of the<br />
Rev. Joseph King, of Oundle, who departed this<br />
life the 25th day of April, 1763, aged 81 years.<br />
<br />
Farewell, bright soul, a long farewell,<br />
Till we shall meet again above,<br />
In the sweet groves where pleasures dwell,<br />
And trees of life bear fruits of love.<br />
<br />
Sweet soul, we leave thee to thy rest;<br />
Enjoy thy Jesus and thy God,<br />
Till we, from bonds of clay released,<br />
Spring out, and climb th' heav'nly road.<br />
</div>

<p>The next pastor of the Church at Oundle was Mr.
Daniel Goodrich; his name was inserted in the first
trust deed of the Meeting House, in 1724. In the
account which Doddridge gives of his ordination at
Northampton, in 1730, he mentions Mr. Goodrich, of
Oundle, as commencing the service by prayer and
reading the Scriptures. In the memoirs of Mr. Sanderson,
one of the pastors of the Church at Rowell, we
find a short letter from Mr. Goodrich, dated December
26th, 1740, which pleasingly indicates the spirit of
piety, and the attachment of the writer to evangelical
principles.</p>

<blockquote><p>I thank you for your long expected favour, and am glad to
find that you hang upon the covenant; it is the great prop
and support of our souls. Pleasant frames, and to live by
sense, are what we are fond of; but faith and patience must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
have their perfect work here&mdash;these shall have nothing to do
above. Then the redeemed of the Lord shall live by sight, in
full fruition&mdash;see face to face, and know as they are known;
no clouds shall come between their beloved and them; no
corruptions from within, no thorns and briars from without;
and a brother shall not then be as a thorn hedge; but as God
is love, we shall be like him, swallowed up in love to God and
to one another. A little while, and thus it shall be. The
wilderness is but a short passage, though difficult and troublesome.
Our lights are but to burn here for a little while.
The Lord grant, that we may so shine that our heavenly
Father may be glorified.</p>

<p>I beg the Lord may fit you for your work, and crown your
labours with success, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">D. Goodrich.</span>
</div></blockquote>

<p>At the ordination of Mr. Boyce over the Church at
Kettering, Mr. Goodrich was engaged in asking the
questions and offering the ordination prayer. He died
February 25th, 1765, aged 66 years.</p>

<p>In the report of Homerton College, the name of
Jeremiah Longfield is given, as a student who settled
at Oundle. Though the exact date does not appear, it
seems to have been soon after the death of Mr. Goodrich.</p>

<p>The next in succession appears to have been Mr.
Wm. Ward, who was ordained at Oundle, and continued
there for about four years, when he removed to
Dudley.</p>

<p>After Mr. Ward, Mr. Wright, from Ringwood, was
the pastor for twelve years. He died at Boston, and
was buried in the Chapel at Oundle, where also his
wife and two daughters were interred.</p>

<p>Mr. R. Forsyth was pastor for two years, and then
Mr. Reynold Hogg, who was afterwards minister at
Kimbolton and Thrapstone, and treasurer of the Baptist
Missionary Society.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Isaac Cooke was pastor for two years, when he
removed to Narborough.</p>

<p>Mr. Joseph Chadwick became the pastor of this
Church in the year 1790, and continued his ministry
here for forty years. Mr. Chadwick was a native of
Trull, near Taunton, in Somersetshire, where he was
born in 1751. He has been heard to say, that his father
was a man of no energy, and that whatever advantage
he might gain from parental instruction, or example,
or aid, was derived from his mother. We have heard,
that he was a descendant from the early Nonconformists,
and he evidently took a great interest in the memorials
of their trials and sufferings. Of this he gave
a singular proof at a meeting of the County Association,
held at Ashley, when he delivered a sermon from Heb.
x. 34, "And took joyfully the spoiling of your goods,
knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better
and an enduring substance;" at the close of his discourse
reading some memoranda of the sufferings and
losses, the fines exacted, the goods sold, &amp;c., of our
Nonconformist forefathers. There was a person of the
same name, a Mr. Joseph Chadwick, ejected from the
living of Winesford, in Somersetshire, of whom Mr.
Chadwick was great-grandson. He was also a descendant
of Mr. Thorn, ejected from Weymouth, Dorset.</p>

<p>In his youth he was apprenticed to a peruke-maker
and hair-dresser, at Taunton. During the course of
his apprenticeship, his general conduct and marked
piety, and ardent thirst for knowledge, as indicated by
his love of reading, attracted the attention of John
Toller, Esq., an attorney at Taunton, and the grandfather
of the late Rev. T. N. Toller, of Kettering.
That gentleman, it is thought, bought out the latter
part of Mr. Chadwick's apprenticeship, and sent him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
to study under the Rev. Mr. Kirkup, of South Petherton,
who had been the preceptor of the late Mr. Toller's
early years. With Mr. Kirkup Mr. Chadwick continued
two years, and made remarkable progress in his
studies, especially in the classics. At the expiration
of his residence with Mr. Kirkup, he was sent, under
Mr. Toller's patronage, to the Western College, as his
name stands in the list of their students. He was first
settled at Wellington, Somersetshire; from whence,
after a few years, he removed to Sherborne, in Dorsetshire,
and came from thence to Oundle. He was
a man of considerable learning, and an indefatigable
reader of the most solid works in theology and in general
literature. He resigned his charge at Midsummer,
1831. He died May 7, 1841, in the 90th year of his
age. Mr. Toller, of Kettering, preached his funeral
sermon.</p>

<p>Mr. Ebenezer Prant, from Highbury College, succeeded
Mr. Chadwick. He resigned his charge in
1835, and is now one of the Secretaries to the London
Missionary Society.</p>

<p>Mr. Abraham Calovius Simpson, LL.D., of the
Glasgow University, was the next pastor, serving this
Church and congregation in the ministry of the Gospel
from 1836 to 1841, when he resigned his charge.</p>

<p>The present pastor, Mr. Alfred Newth&mdash;who studied
at Homerton College, and had been previously
settled at Ripley, near Christ Church, Hants&mdash;came
to Oundle in the year 1842, as the successor of Dr.
Simpson. The present number of communicants is
about 70. There are 120 children in the Sabbath-schools.</p>

<p>Occasional services are conducted in two villages in
the vicinity of Oundle, viz., Tansor and Glapthorne.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>MEMORIALS OF THE INDEPENDENT CHURCH AT
WEEDON BECK.</h3>


<p>In the village of Weedon, about eight miles from
Northampton, where there is a royal military dpt
with barracks for 1500 men, storehouses and magazines
capable of stowing 200,000 small arms, there
stands an Independent Chapel for preaching the Gospel
of peace, and maintaining the cause of Christ by
the voluntary aid of his followers. It is a respectable
village Chapel, capable of seating about 500 hearers;
it has a grave-yard in the front, and commodious
school-rooms behind.</p>

<p>At the time of the Restoration, a Mr. George Martin
was vicar of Weedon. Such was his loyalty, that he
lost an arm for the King in Sir George Booth's rising.
But, as one that "exercised himself to have a conscience
void of offence both towards God and man"&mdash;first fearing
God, then honouring the king&mdash;when the Act of
Uniformity passed, he renounced his connexion with
the Church rather than violate his conscience. Such
was the spirit of the times, that in 1667 he was in
Warwick Gaol for some months, for preaching the
Gospel. Some time after his ejectment he exercised
his ministry amongst a small number of worthy people
at Stony Stratford, who had a great value for his memory
a considerable time after. "He was," we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
informed, "a serious, holy, good-tempered, and courageous
man."</p>

<p>It is probable that the cause of Nonconformity in
Weedon owes its origin to the vicar's separation from
the Church. Such an event would excite the attention
of the people, and promote inquiry among them;
and they would be led to seek those ministrations without
the Church of which they were deprived within
her pale by the oppressive enactments of the day.
There had been a number from Weedon and the neighbourhood
who had gone to the Church at Norton to
hear Mr. Robert Allen, another of the ejected ministers,
who was a very popular preacher, whose Church was
crowded with hearers from the places around.</p>

<p>"A congregation was jointly formed here and at Floor
prior to 1668, in which year the first trust deed is dated."</p>

<p>The earliest known minister of this society was
Mr. Peyto. This person was engaged in the ordination
service of Mr. J. Heywood, at Potterspury, in 1740.
He was succeeded by Mr. Thomas Howe, a native of
Northampton, and one of the Daventry students. "He
removed before 1770 to Yarmouth, in Norfolk, where
he continued until his death. He published several
pamphlets and sermons."</p>

<p>This is the second pastor, as recorded in Baker's
history of this county. But in the early history of
the Church at West End, Wellingborough, we find the
following notice of a Mr. Saywell, who appears to
have been minister at Floor and Weedon: "We ordered
a letter to the Church at Floor, with our judgment
that Mr. Saywell was a member and an officer
there, and ought to abide till his ministry was fulfilled.
We ordered another to the Church at Weedon, to
satisfy them with it, and to encourage them to wait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
with patience." This person must have been about
the second pastor that was placed over them.</p>

<p>Mr. Samuel Braybrook, another Daventry student,
is recorded as succeeding Mr. Howe, and as afterwards
settling at Rendham, in Suffolk.</p>

<p>Then we find the names of Mr. John Offord and
Mr. Phares; and then Mr. William Severn, concerning
whom we are informed "that he was a native
of Nottingham; at an early age became a popular
preacher among the Methodists; was for two years a
travelling associate with their celebrated founder, John
Wesley. But his sentiments undergoing a change, he
went to study divinity at Edinburgh, on leaving which
University he accepted an invitation to this society,
from whence he removed to Welford in 1782, afterwards
to Hinckley, in Leicestershire, where he embraced
Unitarianism. He died at Hull, in June, 1813,
in his fifty-ninth year."</p>

<p>After this, we have the name of Mr. Renfrew; and
after him, Mr. Evan Johns, who removed to Welford;
then Mr. T. Spencer, who was appointed in 1790, and
resigned in a few years after.</p>

<p>Mr. Joseph Gronow was chosen to succeed Mr.
Spencer. He was ordained April 27th, 1797, when
the Rev. Messrs. Chipperfield, Wood, Horsey, Bicknell,
Toller, and Denny engaged in the several parts
of the service.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gronow's ministry was very acceptable and
useful. He died Dec. 9th, 1817. He lost a beloved
wife a few months before his own death. During four
months' severe illness, probably brought on by the loss
of his wife and the removal of a highly esteemed
friend, he manifested a truly Christian spirit. He had
been pastor of the Church more than 21 years, and
the means of greatly improving the state of the society.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Few ministers have been more generally beloved by
those who knew them, or have lived more in the affections
of their people. In the time of his illness preparations
were making for his going to Bath, with the
hope that the waters might, under the blessing of God,
restore his health; but when all the arrangements were
nearly completed, and the funds necessary for such a
journey provided, through the liberality of benevolent
individuals, it pleased God to remove him. The affliction
which he suffered during the last fortnight of his
life was most painful; but the closing scene was remarkably
peaceful. His remains were interred the
following Monday, with every token of respect, under
the pulpit where he had so often preached the Gospel
of Christ. Many of his brethren attended the funeral,
six of whom supported the pall. His death was improved
by Mr. H. Knight, of Yelvertoft, from Acts
xx. 38, to a most numerous and deeply affected congregation."</p>

<p>On a neat mural tablet of white marble, at the right
hand of the pulpit, is the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
This Stone<br />
has been raised by an affectionate congregation<br />
to the memory of their beloved pastor,<br />
the <span class="smcap">Rev. Joseph Gronow</span>,<br />
who for more than twenty-one years<br />
continued diligently, faithfully, and successfully<br />
to discharge the duties of his office.<br />
His affection, simplicity, sympathy, and sincerity<br />
conciliated the respect of all who knew him,<br />
and peculiarly endeared him to his flock.<br />
With great calmness, and with a blessed hope<br />
of a glorious immortality,<br />
he closed his mortal course, December the 9th, 1817,<br />
aged 49.<br />
"Though dead, he yet speaks to his people,"<br />
for whose salvation he always manifested the greatest solicitude.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Gronow was about the middle stature, plain in
appearance; as a preacher, serious, affectionate, fervent.
Plainness and simplicity marked his language
and the plan of his sermons, while they were full of evangelical
truth, setting forth experimental and practical
piety. He preached as one concerned for the honour
of his great Master and the good of immortal souls.
Mr. Gronow had been assistant for a short time to Mr.
Maurice, of Stretton-under-Fosse, before he came to
Weedon. He was succeeded by Mr. James Pinkerton,
who had been a student at the Newport Academy, and
was ordained here May 6th, 1819, and was pastor of
this Church for thirteen years. In the year 1831 he
resigned, and removed to Totteridge, near London;
but he had not filled this situation more than two
years, we believe, before he was summoned from the
scenes of time and the services of the Church on earth.
Mr. Pinkerton was of a very amiable and pious spirit,
devoted to his Master's work. His sermons appeared
to be well prepared, full of important and appropriate
thought, discovering some energy of mind, and delivered
with animation of manner. He frequently
preached at the meetings of the County Association,
and was always heard with interest.</p>

<p>At the close of 1831, the present pastor, Mr. Isaac
Evans, came on probation, and was ordained July
24th, 1832. During the ministry of Mr. Evans a new
school-room has been erected, at the cost of 120,
which was opened in the year 1847. The Sabbath-school
is conducted here, containing about 125
children.</p>

<p>The present number of communicants is 80. One
service is conducted at Floor every Sabbath, where
the congregation is considered as a branch of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Church at Weedon. The present Chapel there was
built in the year 1810.</p>

<p>Some alterations and improvements have recently
been made in the Chapel at Weedon, at a cost of 115,
which will, we trust, add to the comfort of the place
and the accommodation of the congregation. All would
be accompanied with the fervent and united desire of
the pastor and his flock that abundant tokens of the
blessing of the great Head of the Church may attend
all their efforts.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>MEMORIALS OF THE INDEPENDENT CHURCH AT
LONG BUCKBY.</h3>


<p>The populous village of Long Buckby, containing
more than 2600 inhabitants, has a neat and commodious
Independent Chapel, capable of seating about
700 hearers, with convenient school-rooms, and a respectable
dwelling-house for the minister. Previous
to the erection of the present building there was an
old Chapel, which had stood for many years in another
situation; but it is much to be regretted in this case,
as in some others, that no accounts have been preserved
of the origin or early history of this Church.</p>

<p>Before the year 1662, when Mr. Richard Allen, who
became one of the ejected ministers, preached in the
parish Church of Norton, a short distance from this
village, amongst other places mentioned from which
hearers came to attend on his ministry, there were
some from Long Buckby; but whether it was very
soon after the ejectment of their favourite preacher
that they sought the ministration of the Nonconformists
in this place we have no account. The earliest notice
we find of an Independent minister at Long Buckby
is in the account of the ordination of Mr. Tingey, at
Northampton, in 1709, when a Mr. Jackson, minister
at Long Buckby, was present. In the account which
Mr. Sanders, one of the pastors of the Church at Kettering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
gives of his ordination, as preserved in the records
of that Church, which took place November 23,
1721, he states&mdash;"Mr. Cartwright, of Buckby, began
with prayer, and prayed well." This proves to us
that there was a Mr. Cartwright, a Dissenting minister,
at Buckby, 131 years ago. Again, we find his signature
attached to the certificate of Mr. Hextal's ordination
at Creaton in 1738, which shows us that his
ministry extended over some considerable period in
this place. He was also engaged in the ordination of
Mr. J. Heywood, at Potterspury, in 1740.</p>

<p>As a further memorial of him, we have discovered a
very old upright gravestone in the Churchyard of Long
Buckby, erected to his memory. With some considerable
difficulty we deciphered the inscription, which
states concisely his age, the time of his death, and the
character he bore.</p>

<div class="center">
In memory<br />
of the Rev. Mr. <span class="smcap">Thomas Cartwright</span>,<br />
who died April 13th, 1744, aged 57;<br />
having by a diligent, faithful, and humble discharge<br />
of the various duties of the Christian and<br />
ministerial life,<br />
obtained a good report of all men,<br />
and of the truth itself;<br />
being most highly esteemed of those<br />
by whom he was most intimately known.
</div>

<p>Mr. Cartwright left a widow, who survived him
thirty-nine years.</p>

<p>The next pastor of this Church was a Mr. Walker,
but of his life or ministry we find no records preserved.</p>

<p>Mr. Richard Denny became pastor of this Church
in 1763, and continued his labours for nearly forty
years. During his ministry the present Meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
House was built, in 1771; and in one part of that
ministry a remarkable revival of religion took place,
followed by permanent results of the most important
kind. He was the last surviving student of Dr. Doddridge,
for whom he retained to his last day the
strongest affection. He survived until the year 1813,
when he died at the age of nearly 90 years, having
been disabled from regular public service for almost
twenty years.</p>

<p>Mr. Denny was born at Barby, a small village in
Northamptonshire. Having pious parents, he was
from a child the subject of religious impressions. Serving
an apprenticeship at Lutterworth, the preaching
of the Gospel he heard there deepened and ripened
these impressions, so that he was led at an early age
to make a solemn dedication of himself to God as his
Creator and Redeemer.</p>

<p>He was recommended to an eligible mercantile situation
in the metropolis; but a peculiar coincidence of
circumstances rendered his application unsuccessful,
and, as he had long felt a great desire to devote himself
to the work of the ministry, and that desire having
been confirmed by his attendance while in London on
the labours of Mr. Whitefield, the sacred flame of holy
zeal was so enkindled in his breast, that from an ardent
concern to honour his Saviour in the conversion of
sinners, he now consecrated himself to this work.
Being introduced to the notice of Dr. Doddridge, he
kindly and cordially received him under his tuition.
Though there was a great disparity between him and
his tutor in talents and acquirements, yet there was a
great resemblance in Christian affection, holy zeal, and
ardent piety; and such was his regard to the "dear
Doctor," as he generally styled him, that he often mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
his name and his excellencies with the tear
glistening in his eye.</p>

<p>He was placed in two situations as minister after
leaving the academy before he came to reside at Long
Buckby; but here was the scene of the largest portion
of his ministerial life, his labour, and his success;
and at one particular time, as we have hinted, he was
honoured with what was considered as remarkable
success. He had been repeatedly complaining of the
want of a blessing on his labours, and was greatly
discouraged; but he wrestled hard, to use his own
expression, by fervent and constant prayer, for a blessing
to attend his efforts, and his great Master heard
the voice of his supplication. There was an extraordinary
revival in the congregation at large; many
were awakened to the most serious concern about
their everlasting interests; and in the course of two
or three years about forty members were added to
the Church.</p>

<p>After he had resigned his charge, in consequence
of advancing years, he set an attractive example of
piety and holy consistency; his lively and spiritual
conversation was rendered useful to many. In his
intercourse with Christian friends he manifested the
supporting and cheering influence of religion under
the infirmities of age, affording the most pleasing
evidence of its reality and power. He was so remarkable
for his kind and affectionate disposition, that he
was often compared to the apostle John. He could
converse on divine subjects to the last, when his frame
was enfeebled and his mental powers weakened. Dr.
Watts' Hymns were his constant companions; and
those sentiments in them which appear almost too
seraphic for common minds, exactly suited the element<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
in which he lived. In his last hours he said, "I shall
soon see the blessed, blessed Redeemer, and the dear
Doctor Doddridge." When he could no longer speak,
he intimated a wish that his finger might be placed
on a particular verse in Watts' Hymns. This is the
language in which he wished to express the sentiments
and feelings of his soul, when his lips could no longer
move&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Dearest of all the names above,</span><br />
<span class="i1">My Jesus and my God,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Who can resist thy heavenly love,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Or trifle with thy blood?"</span>
</div>

<p>He died April 13th, 1813, and his remains were interred
in the Meeting House he had been the means
of erecting, and near the pulpit he had so long and so
usefully filled. Six neighbouring ministers attended
his funeral, and one of them, Mr. Gronow, of Weedon,
delivered an affecting and suitable address on the occasion.
The following Sabbath the funeral sermon
was preached by his successor, Mr. D. Griffiths, to a
very crowded audience, from Rev. xiv. 13: "And I
heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me, write,
Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from
henceforth; yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest
from their labours; and their works do follow them."</p>

<p>The immediate successor of Mr. Denny was Mr.
Mosely, who came from Atherstone to Buckby, continued
here about eight years, and then removed to
Hanley, in Staffordshire. It was during the ministry
of Mr. Mosely that the present dwelling-house was
built for the minister.</p>

<p>Mr. Daniel Griffiths was the next pastor of the
Church; he commenced his stated ministry at Buckby
March 27th, 1803, and was ordained the 17th of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
November following, when Mr. Anthony, of Bedford,
began the service by prayer and reading the Scriptures;
Mr. Horsey, of Northampton, delivered the
introductory discourse, asked the questions, and received
the confession of faith; Mr. Denny, the former
pastor, offered the ordination prayer; Mr. Toller, of
Kettering, gave the charge, from 1st Tim. iv. 13-16;
Mr. Gill, of Harborough, addressed the people, from
Deut. i. 38; Mr. Knight and Mr. Morrell were engaged
in the devotional parts of the service; and Mr.
Cox, of Clipstone, preached in the evening, from
Matt. vi. 33.</p>

<p>The ministry of Mr. Griffiths was continued in this
place for thirty-nine years. In the year 1819, the
congregation having much increased, the Chapel was
considerably enlarged, and a fourth gallery erected, at
an expense of more than 300, which was cheerfully
defrayed by the people. At the re-opening of the
Chapel in September, the late Mr. Toller, of Kettering,
preached, and it is supposed to have been the
last time that he officiated out of his own pulpit.
Mr. Robertson, then of Stretton, in Warwickshire,
"preached," observes Mr. Griffiths, "a noble sermon
in the evening, from 'All souls are mine.'"</p>

<p>In the year 1825 a new and commodious school-room
was erected, by means of a legacy of 50 left
by Mr. David Ashby for that purpose; the remainder
of the cost being defrayed by the relatives of Mr.
Ashby.</p>

<p>Mr. Griffiths resigned his charge on the 19th of
December, 1841. He still survives, and, with the
remaining strength of declining life, is able to preach
once on the Sabbath to assist his son, who is minister
at Cannock, in Staffordshire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>After the resignation of Mr. Griffiths, the congregation
was supplied for some time chiefly by the
students from Spring Hill College; but at length an
invitation was given to Mr. Apperly, from Blackburn
Academy, who entered on his pastoral duties on the
2nd of October, 1842.</p>

<p>The ministry of Mr. Apperly continued for about
ten years. We regret to state that the congregation
did not remain in a united or prosperous state; and
on the 4th of July, 1852, Mr. Apperly resigned and
emigrated to Australia. His friends, as a token of
their regard, made him a present of thirty guineas
before his departure.</p>

<p>The present number of communicants is near 50.
There are 100 children in the Sabbath-schools.</p>

<p>The interest of 230, and the rent of a small close
of land, amounting in the whole to about 17 per
annum, belong to the place towards the support of the
minister for the time being.</p>

<p>A village containing the population there is in
Long Buckby, with everything convenient for the
worship of God, the ministry of the word, and the
instruction of the young, in the commodious Chapel
and school-rooms, presents an interesting sphere of
labour; and we hope to hear that this cause again
revives and extends, under the labours of a devoted
and successful pastor.</p>

<p>Mr. F. Evans, of Ulverston, Lancashire, has accepted
an invitation to the pastoral office, and was
to commence his stated labours here October 31st,
1852.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>MEMORIALS OF THE INDEPENDENT CHURCH AT
POTTERSPURY.</h3>


<p>The Independent Church in this place has existed
about 160 years; not tracing its origin quite to the
earliest days of Nonconformity, but commencing about
thirty years after the passing of the "Bartholomew
Act." It was not by the immediate operation of that
Act, leading an ejected minister to raise a congregation
of Nonconformists here, as in many other places, but by
its gradual influence, that it led on to the formation
of this Church.</p>

<p>At the time of the passing of the Act referred to,
in 1662, the village was favoured with the ministry
of Mr. Joseph Newell, who was sufficiently conscientious
not hastily to submit to the requirements of this
Act, for he suffered himself to be ejected from his
living, though he subsequently conformed; but the
minister by whose labour this Church was formed
was the Rev. Michael Harrison, who preached in the
parish Church of Caversfield, Bucks, and resided in
the vicarage there, where he had performed the duties
of a faithful minister of Christ for a number of years.
He became dissatisfied with the terms of conformity;
maintained familiar intercourse with evangelical Dissenters;
and at length became fully prepared to recede
from the Church.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Calamy, who was then studying at Oxford, says:
"There were at this time monthly fasts appointed by
authority, and generally observed very regularly, to
implore the divine blessing in order to the success of
our forces. At one of these fasts I was at Bicester,
and assisted old Mr. Cornish, who was indisposed, at
his Meeting House, in the morning; and afterwards
walked over to Caversfield, about a mile distant, the
Dissenters in a body bearing me company. There I
preached in the public Church in the afternoon, and
had a crowded Church from the country round. Mr.
M. Harrison preached in the Church, of which Mr.
Beard was patron; and he lived in the house adjoining.
But Mr. Harrison was now from home, in Northamptonshire,
where he was gathering a congregation
of Dissenters about Potterspury, designing to quit the
Church and settle among them."</p>

<p>Mr. Harrison's efforts were successful; he soon
gathered around him some friends, removed to reside
amongst them, formed a Congregational Church, and
purchased a property, on which he fitted up a place of
worship.</p>

<p>When Mr. Harrison removed to Pury, a Mr. John
Warr, who formerly lived in the neighbourhood of
Caversfield, came with him to enjoy the benefit of his
ministry. And connected with this circumstance is
another, which will show something of the spirit of
the times. "When Mr. Harrison came to Pury, he
brought a pulpit with him, which he deemed it necessary
to conceal; therefore, to prevent it being known,
Mr. Warr, being a shoemaker, contrived to fill it with
shoe-pegs, and brought it among his own goods in a
waggon from Bicester."</p>

<p>Some property his wife possessed, in the county of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
Chester, it is supposed was sold, to enable Mr. Harrison
to purchase the premises on which his dwelling-house
and the Meeting House were fitted up. When
the barn which formed the humble Meeting House was
prepared, at the request of the people Dr. Calamy
preached at the opening, and had a numerous auditory.
It should here be observed, that the disinterestedness
and sincerity of Mr. Harrison were strikingly evinced
by his willingness not only to relinquish his clerical
stipend, but to hazard his own private property
amongst a people who had never been accustomed to
make voluntary efforts for the support of the Gospel
ministry. He trusted, however, to the great principles
for which he made these sacrifices, and to the faithfulness
of their glorious Author; and he did not trust in
vain. After labouring here about nineteen years, Mr.
Harrison removed in the year 1709, and became the
minister of an Independent Church at St. Ives, in the
county of Huntingdon, where he continued to labour
for many years, and died in January, 1726, leaving
two daughters to lament their loss.</p>

<p>The property at Pury now passed into other hands;
for Mr. Harrison, on leaving, sold it to a gentleman in
the neighbourhood of London; reserving, however, to
the people the pulpit and other fittings of the Meeting
House. The congregation for some time rented the
place; but subsequently purchased the whole property,
and vested it in the hands of trustees.</p>

<p>The immediate successors of Mr. Harrison did not
continue long at Potterspury, and of their labours little
is known.</p>

<p>The first of these was the Rev. Mr. Bennett, who,
declining to take the pastoral office, soon removed, and
was followed by the Rev. Isaac Robinson, who sustained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the pastoral office about four years. In 1714, the
Rev. Wm. Bushnell was the pastor, and continued to
preach here till Michaelmas, 1729, when he left, and
removed to Andover, in Herefordshire; and from
thence, in 1732, to Nailsworth. He was succeeded at
Pury by the Rev. Samuel Taylor.</p>

<p>The minister of whom we have the fullest account,
and whose ministry appears to have been most extensively
and permanently useful in this Church, though
attended with some eccentricities that diminished its
value, was the Rev. John Heywood, who came from
Lincoln to this place in 1739. "After preaching here
for about twelve months, he was ordained September
25th, 1740; on which occasion Mr. Petto, of Floor,
began the service with prayer; Mr. Cartwright, of Long
Buckby, prayed before sermon; Mr. Hunt, of Hackney,
preached the sermon to the people; Mr. Clark, of St.
Alban's, offered the ordination prayer, accompanied
with imposition of hands; Dr. Doddridge gave the
charge; and Mr. Drake, of Yardley Hastings, concluded
with prayer."</p>

<p>When Mr. Heywood passed his examination previous
to his ordination, he was required to maintain
the following thesis in Latin&mdash;"The Scriptures a rule
of faith." The manuscript, carefully and curiously
written, together with the hymn which he composed
to be sung at the ordination, remains to the present
day, as a proof of his learning and a specimen of his
talents. The ordination hymn, and about forty others
which he composed for the use of his congregation,
were afterwards published, dedicated to Dr. Doddridge,
with whom Mr. Heywood was on intimate terms, and
to whom he expresses himself as under very great
obligations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>At the time of this settlement the Church appears
to have consisted of fifty-seven members, of whom
fifteen had been admitted by Mr. Harrison, one by Mr.
Robinson, twenty-four by Mr. Bushnell, and nineteen
by Mr. Taylor.</p>

<p>The following Church covenant was drawn up by
Mr. Heywood, which is agreed to by all who join the
Church:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><div class="center">
<i>Church Covenant.</i>
</div>

<p>1. We avouch the Lord this day to be our God, and ourselves
to be his people, in the truth and sincerity of our
hearts.</p>

<p>2. We call heaven and earth, angels and men, to witness
this day that we recognize our baptismal covenant, and give
up ourselves to God the Father, Son, and Spirit, as our Creator,
Redeemer, and Sanctifier, in an everlasting covenant
never to be forgotten.</p>

<p>3. We do bind ourselves, in the presence of God, to walk
together in his ways; to attend upon his word and ordinances
of his grace; resolving to cleave to the Lord Jesus Christ,
and to him alone, for pardon and salvation.</p>

<p>4. We do sincerely promise, through divine assistance, to
make the glory of God our aim and end; to watch against
everything that would offend God, grieve his Holy Spirit, and
bring a reproach upon the good way of God.</p>

<p>5. We solemnly promise to walk with all our fellow Christians
with all humility and tenderness; to love one another,
even as Christ has loved us, and given himself for us; to avoid
jealousies, suspicions, backbitings, censurings, provokings,
secret risings of spirit against them; to bear and forbear, to
give and forgive, as our dear Lord has taught us.</p>

<p>6. At all times we desire, by the help of divine grace, to
watch against everything that would offend our fellow Christians,
and promise to be willing to submit to the advice and
council of our minister and fellow Christians.</p>

<p>7. We promise to behave with all possible loyalty and allegiance
to his sacred Majesty King George, and to pray for him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
and all his royal family, that God may bless them, and confound
all the designs and blast the counsels of all his enemies,
both at home and abroad.</p>

<p>8. We promise to cultivate the duties of the closet, and to
promote family prayer, that God may dwell with us and bless
us, and all that are dear to us. We also promise to abound in
the strict sanctification of the Lord's-day, and to bring all we
can under the droppings of God's sanctuary. And all this we
promise, not in our own strength and power, but in the name
and strength of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whose blood we
desire this covenant may be sprinkled.</p></blockquote>

<p>Such was the active spirit and ardent zeal of Mr.
Heywood, that he engaged in an extensive range of
itinerant labour, not only in the villages in which his
predecessors had preached, but in many and more remote
places, where, but for his abundant efforts, the
Gospel would have been unknown. He kept a journal
of all the places in which he preached. Great prosperity
in the Church appeared to be the result of these
zealous and faithful labours. Mr. Heywood addressed
a pastoral letter, on "the nature and importance of
regeneration," to the Church and congregation, which
are represented as residing in about twenty places
around Potterspury, the names of which are given. In
this wide sphere of pastoral labour, Mr. Heywood used
to travel for many years on an old grey horse, which
often stumbled, and sometimes fell; but he, nothing injured
or dismayed, would prosecute his journey with
his waistcoat open, and the long ends of his neckcloth
streaming in the wind, while his tall lank figure, his
slovenly appearance, and his too often despised employment,
caused him to be regarded by many as among the
most eccentric of men. This impression was doubtless
increased by the colloquial style of his village discourses,
in which he often condescended to employ the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
common provincial expressions. The excellent Mr.
Robins, in his memoir of Mr. Strange, of Kilsby, speaks
of Mr. Heywood as "that singular gentleman, much
more famed for his zeal than for the prudence or propriety
of his conduct."</p>

<p>But he made suitable preparation for his more stated
labours, and preserved his taste for classical and polite
literature; a great many sermons, beautifully written
in a peculiar kind of long hand, prove the former, while
his association with noblemen of patriotic and classical
minds in the neighbourhood proves the latter. His
Grace the Duke of Grafton not only condescended to
visit him, but gave him free access to his library at
Wakefield, as he did also his immediate successor. The
Duke was in principle a Dissenter, and in sentiment a
Unitarian. Though his Grace differed widely from
both Mr. Heywood and his successor, he was very
kind to them both; he once, at least, attended at the
Meeting at Pury, and till the time of his death subscribed
10 a year to the support of the cause. His
subscription was continued some time after his death,
but withdrawn at the decease of the Rev. Isaac
Gardner.</p>

<p>But Earl Temple, the noble proprietor of Stowe,
formed a much closer intimacy with Mr. Heywood; his
classic wit, sound learning, and inflexible patriotism, induced
his Lordship to spend much time in the company
of this worthy pastor. On the death of George II.,
he preached and printed a sermon on the occasion,
which he dedicated to his noble friend. An amusing
anecdote in connexion with this nobleman is related of
Mr. Heywood, in the following words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Soon after the accession of George III., as was usual on
such occasions, the Dissenting body went up to the throne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
with an address of congratulation. Mr. Heywood, who was
known to them, went up with them; but when he came into
the Royal Palace at St. James's, he happened to see there his
friend Earl Temple, with whom he immediately entered into
conversation. Nothing could equal the vexation of the London
ministers, when they saw Mr. Heywood enter the room at Dr.
Williams's library, where they were assembled to go to the
Royal Palace, nor their surprize at finding that he was the
only one of their number who had a friend at Court; for their
plain-looking country brother had no sooner entered than he
was recognized by Earl Temple. While Mr. Heywood was
conversing with the noble Earl, the ministers were admitted
to his Majesty's presence, kissed hands, and were in the act
of returning, which being perceived by Earl Temple, he suggested
to Mr. Heywood the danger of losing the opportunity
he came to enjoy. Mr. Heywood instantly turned round,
and passing by his brethren who were returning, called out to
the King, as he retired from the throne, "Stop, please your
Majesty, stop! I have come all the way from Potterspury to
kiss your Majesty's hand, and I hope I shall be allowed the
honour." The King, with all that excellency of disposition
for which he was remarkable, turned round and presented his
hand. Mr. Heywood gave it two or three hearty kisses, adding,
"God bless your Majesty! and I hope you will make a good
King."</p></blockquote>

<p>Scenes and associations like these, however, formed
but parentheses in the history of this devoted man,
whose general occupation in the instruction of the
young, village preaching, and pastoral visits, secured
him more satisfaction, and doubtless more honour too,
than the noblest friendships earth could have supplied.
Scarcely a Church-meeting was held without some
addition to the society through his useful labours. It
appears that during the many years he was pastor,
there was not more than one person suspended from
Church fellowship for improper conduct.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Heywood was unfortunate in his marriage
relation, and for twenty-eight years endured all the
painful consequences of not taking heed to "marry in
the Lord"; his home was uncomfortable, his work as
a minister of the Gospel often impeded, and its difficulties
increased. The violence of disposition, equalled
only by the selfishness, of his wife, formed quite a contrast
to the amiableness and liberality of his own.
The effects of this unsuitable union were partly apparent
in his neglected person and comfortless appearance;
but what his spirits suffered from it was known only
to God, to whom it was presented in the many prayers
he offered up on her account. These prayers were
ultimately answered, and in the year 1768 he had the
great happiness to receive her into the Church of
which he was pastor.</p>

<p>Other domestic afflictions came upon him; particularly
the loss of a beloved and only son, who, having
evinced true piety from his earliest years, was devoted
to the ministry, and studying with Dr. Ashworth, at
Daventry; when on the 3rd of May, 1762, he was
drowned while bathing, in the eighteenth year of his
age. The pressure of these afflictions, together with
the effects of unremitting labour and frequent exposure
to wet and cold in his village excursions, began to
show themselves in his constitution, and his health and
strength declined. His dread, however, of being an
idle servant, induced him to continue his efforts to the
utmost extent. At length he was obliged to relinquish
all public engagements but those of his own pulpit, for
which he soon became unequal; but when he could no
longer ascend the desk or walk to the Meeting House,
he insisted on being carried there, and, seated in one of
the aisles, like the beloved Apostle he continued to exhort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
his people to come to Christ. His great affection
and solicitude for children and young persons was
always displayed; and when confined to his bed in his
last sickness, this anxiety did not forsake him, for he
would have the young people of his charge assembled
in interesting groups around his bed-side, and, after
addressing them with much Christian feeling, he desired
them to kneel down that he might lay his hands
upon them, with fervent petitions for the divine blessing
to rest upon them. At length, while surrounded
by a few of his chosen friends, to whom he bore
a peaceful testimony of the grace of Christ, he fell
asleep in the Lord on the 1st of January, 1778. His
venerable friend, the Rev. William Bull, of Newport,
preached his funeral sermon.</p>

<p>Whilst this excellent man displayed at times an
eccentric manner, and there might be something imprudent
connected with his zeal, yet his excellent
temper, disinterested labours, sound learning, and true
piety, secured for him the respect and veneration of
many; and the formation of several flourishing congregations,
and the conversion of many souls, prove
that he did not labour in vain.</p>

<p>As might have been expected, when Mr. Heywood's
village labours decreased, the Church and congregation
became much reduced, and it required the services
of a young and devoted man to revive the declining
interest.</p>

<p>Mr. John Goode, a student at Newport Academy,
had assisted Mr. Heywood before his death, and he
was invited to become the pastor, and was ordained
October 24th, 1782, when his tutor, Mr. Bull, gave
him the charge, from 1st Kings xx. 11: "Let not him
that girdeth on his armour boast as he that putteth it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
off." The declining congregation was greatly revived;
for though Mr. Goode did not attempt to fill the whole
sphere of labour which his predecessor occupied, yet
he preached in all the principal places. A decisive
proof of his success remains in the present Meeting,
and the pastoral house adjoining. The old Meeting
House, which had originally been a barn or out-building
belonging to what was called "Padder's Farm,"
and in which the congregation had assembled from its
first establishment, was now pulled down with the old
house adjoining, in which Mr. Harrison and his successors
had resided. The present Meeting House and
Parsonage were erected on the site, and the former
was opened for public worship by Mr. Bull on the
9th of August, 1780.</p>

<p>Mr. Goode was born at Buckingham, March 26th,
1754. He served a regular apprenticeship to an apothecary
there. During his early days, Buckingham
Church was favoured with the ministry of the excellent
Rev. David Simpson, afterwards of Macclesfield,
well known as the author of the 'Plea for Religion
and the Holy Scriptures.' Mr. Goode and his brother,
afterwards the Rev. William Goode, the successor of
the celebrated Romaine, at Blackfriars, were brought
to the knowledge of the truth under the ministry of
Mr. Simpson. When brought earnestly to attend to
his own salvation, he had a lively and anxious solicitude
after the salvation of others. He was in the
habit of rising early, and, accompanied by a few young
friends, going to preach in some of the neighbouring
cottages, and then returning to his daily duties at the
time of commencing business. He also frequently met
a few friends in the evening at a private house for
prayer, and the exhortations he then delivered appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
to have been made useful to many, who lived to
exemplify the power of religion. It is a pleasing fact,
which deserves to be recorded in connexion with this
little social meeting, that the great Head of the Church
was at this time training up three of its members to
occupy important stations of usefulness in distinct
portions of his vineyard&mdash;the subject of this account,
his brother (afterwards the clergyman of Blackfriars),
and the Rev. James Hinton, for many years the highly-esteemed
and useful pastor of the Baptist Church in
the city of Oxford.</p>

<p>Mr. Goode determined on devoting himself to the
work of the ministry, entered the academy at Newport,
and from thence came to Pury, where he continued
for fourteen years. The Duke of Grafton
favoured Mr. Goode with many marks of kind attention
and friendship. An epistolary correspondence
which passed between them at different times is still
preserved, which, while it illustrates the liberal and
condescending respect of the nobleman, exhibits the
consistent though gentlemanly demeanour of the Christian
pastor, availing himself of any opportunity that
offered to do good. At length Mr. Goode removed
to London: the Church at White Row, deprived by
death of a popular and excellent minister, the Rev. Mr.
Trotman, invited Mr. Goode to become their pastor.
This removal was very unfavourable to the Church
and congregation at Pury; a sad state of trials and
difficulties was soon experienced. At White Row Mr.
Goode continued to labour for thirty years, during a
considerable portion of which he had a large congregation,
and was the instrument of conversion and edification
to many. In the latter part of his ministry, in
consequence of removals and deaths, it was much reduced;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
but in the year 1819 there were 150 members
in communion.</p>

<p>After the removal of Mr. Goode, the members of
this Church who resided at Towcester, deeming it
more expedient to form themselves into a separate
Church than continue their attendance at Pury, five
miles distant, were dismissed from this connexion for
this purpose, which was the commencement of the
Independent Church in that town.</p>

<p>The Rev. George Vowell, of Homerton Academy,
was invited as a candidate for the pastoral office after
Mr. Goode's removal, and entered upon his labours
here. He had not long resided at Pury before he was
married to Miss Hall, the only child of Mr. Abraham
Hall, a gentleman of considerable reputation and property,
in Aldermanbury, London; but not many weeks
after this, symptoms of a rapid decline made their
appearance, and terminated his short but honourable
life, November 20th, 1795, aged 23 years.</p>

<p>The Rev. Stephen Morrell preached here for some
months, and afterwards settled at Kilsby.</p>

<p>Early in 1795, Rev. William Whitefoot preached for
several Sabbaths; but as his doctrinal sentiments were
not approved by all the congregation, he withdrew to
Hanslope, and with him the members of the Church
who resided there seceded, and in that village a separate
cause was attempted.</p>

<p>During the two following years, the Rev. Messrs.
Savage, May, and Saunders preached as candidates,
but no permanent arrangements were concluded. In
September, 1798, the Rev. E. White was invited as
a candidate for the pastoral charge; and in March,
1799, the Church, which had by this time fallen into
a very low state, was re-organized under his direction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
there being only eight of the members then remaining
united together out of forty-seven which had belonged
to the Church under Mr. Goode's ministry; five others
were admitted at the time of the re-organization. Mr.
White continued to preach at Pury till October, 1800,
when he finally declined accepting a call to the pastoral
office, and removed to Hertford, where he was
ordained in April, 1801. He ultimately went to Chester,
and died there May 5th, 1811.</p>

<p>During the time the Church and congregation were
in this low condition no person took a more lively
interest in their affairs than the Rev. Samuel Greathead,
of Newport; he not only frequently preached
to them and administered the Lord's Supper, but suggested
to them such plans as were likely, through the
blessing of God, to revive the interests of religion
among them. In 1805 he recommended to them the
Rev. Isaac Gardner, then preaching at Newport, in
Essex, as a person likely to suit them as a pastor.
Mr. Gardner came to reside among them, and it was
hoped that the time had come for God again to favour
this part of his Zion; but Mr. Gardner's age rendered
him incapable of the exertions required, and during
the sixteen years he remained at Pury his infirmities
were such as to render him more fit for a station of
comparative ease than for one requiring all the zeal
and activity of youth. During the ministry of Mr.
Gardner another Church was formed at Stony Stratford,
which drew off some of the best subscribers, and
left but few to uphold the mother Church; but about
this time a Mr. Smith, one of the friends to this
Church, left 100, the interest to be paid to the minister
for the time being for ever.</p>

<p>Mr. Gardner died on the 21st of October, 1821, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
the 67th year of his age. A small neat tablet, by the
side of the pulpit, marks the spot where his remains
are deposited.</p>

<p>Again the Church was supplied from the Newport
Academy, and the Rev. James Slye, one of the students,
was invited to become the pastor. He succeeded
Mr. Gardner in 1823, and was ordained on the fifteenth
day of June, 1825, on which occasion the Rev. James
Pinkerton, of Weedon, began with reading the Scriptures
and prayer; the Rev. E. Barling, of Buckingham,
delivered the introductory discourse, and asked the
usual questions; the Rev. D. W. Aston, of Buckingham,
offered the ordination prayer; the Rev. T. P.
Bull, of Newport, gave the charge, from Phil. i. 17;
the Rev. William Chapman, of Greenwich, preached
to the people, from 2nd Cor. v. 18; and the Rev. T.
Adkins, of Southampton, concluded with prayer.</p>

<p>Mr. Slye's settlement was attended with a happy revival
in the congregation; two new galleries were soon
after erected for the accommodation of the children of
the Sabbath-school; and in 1826, the room in which the
evening lecture had been carried on (Yardley Gabion)
being found too small to contain the increased attendance,
a new Chapel was erected, in which service
is regularly conducted on the Sabbath evening. Mr.
Slye still fills the office of pastor here, and continues
his acceptable and useful services amongst this people.
The report of the North Bucks Association, to which
this Church belongs, states "that at Potterspury the
attendance is still good, and there is reason to believe
the word is not preached without effect. The Sabbath-school
continues in an encouraging state. This
place has been visited during the past year by a deputation
from the Missionary Society, and the sum of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
16. 16<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> has been transmitted to the funds of that
institution. Grafton and Alderton are supplied from
this Church as formerly, at both of which places the
attendance is good. The present number of Church
members is 65. There are 130 children in the Sabbath-school.

erected. Services are conducted in three villages in
the vicinity."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>MEMORIALS OF THE INDEPENDENT CHURCH AT
YARDLEY HASTINGS.</h3>


<p>The name of this village is familiar to many of the
lovers of poetry from Cowper's celebrated lines on
"Yardley Oak," standing in "Yardley Chase," about
a mile and a half from the village.</p>

<p>A stranger paying a visit to Yardley might have
his attention excited by the appearance of a large and
beautiful stone building, as an Independent Chapel,
with a respectable minister's house on the south side
of the Chapel, and spacious school-rooms on the north.
The whole of the buildings, standing on an elevation
and being enclosed by a wall and ornamental iron
railing, add much to the appearance of the village.</p>

<p>It would be highly gratifying to any friend to Dissenting
Churches to be able to tell from what small
beginnings this rose, who commenced an Independent
interest here, what difficulties were overcome, what
trials were borne, and with what success the efforts
were crowned. But in these respects disappointment
meets us. Those who first laboured here, and laid
the foundation of this Church, were more anxious, we
presume, to have their services approved and recorded
on high, than to secure a record of them to be handed
down to their successors in the Church below. We
think it would have been wiser if they had left us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
some written memorials of the labours in which they
engaged, and of the blessing that attended them, not
for our gratification merely, but for our encouragement
and improvement.</p>

<p>The earliest trust deed of a Meeting House at Yardley
is dated 1719, and it speaks of the building as
having been recently erected. The first notice that
we have been able to find of a stated minister in
this place occurs in the certificate of Doddridge's
ordination at Northampton, in 1730. One of the
signatures to that document is Mr. J. Drake, of
Yardley. The same name occurs in a certificate which
we have seen, preserved in the handwriting of Doddridge,
of the ordination of the Rev. W. Hextal, at
Creaton, in 1738. Mr. Drake was also present at the
ordination of Mr. Haywood, of Potterspury, in the year
1740, and he also officiated in the ordination service
and signed the certificate of the late Rev. W. Bull, of
Newport, in October, 1766. Thus we learn that he
was for a considerable number of years minister of this
place. It was also stated by the late Mr. Bull, that
during the latter years of his life he resided at Olney,
was pastor of the Independent Church there, and
was accustomed to preach one part of the Sabbath at
Yardley, and the other part at Olney.</p>

<p>About the year 1782, the Church at Yardley, being
destitute of a minister, requested Mr. Thomas Raban,
of Olney, to render them his assistance. After supplying
them with acceptance for some time, he was
invited to become their pastor, and was ordained in
1783. There are some interesting particulars preserved
of the character and labours of Mr. Raban,
which we shall briefly present to the reader. He was
born at Turvey, in the county of Bedford&mdash;the village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
that was for years distinguished by the ministry of
Legh Richmond, and by the results of his ministry
leading to the formation of an Independent Church in
that place. Mr. Raban was apprenticed at Olney,
where he first heard the truths of the Gospel from Mr.
Moses Brown, author of 'Sunday Thoughts,' then the
vicar of Olney. When about ten years of age, he was
deeply convinced of sin, and guided to the Saviour of
sinners. He became a stated hearer and an affectionate
friend of Mr. Brown's, and joined in communion with
the Church. He had occasional opportunities of hearing
Mr. Whitefield, and to his dying day he retained
the savour of the truths which that eminent servant
of Christ delivered. Speaking of Mr. Whitefield, he
would say, "I once had the honour of having him hang
on my arm; and, to be sure, I thought myself the
happiest of men:" at another time&mdash;"I attended him
as a guide to a village where he was going to preach,
to my unspeakable gratification." He sometimes also
attended Mr. Hervey's ministry, and would speak of
his sermons with renewed satisfaction and delight to
the end of his life. About the year 1778, in conjunction
with an intimate friend, he began to exhort at
prayer-meetings attended by members of the establishment.
They persevered in this practice for some time
solely with the view of being serviceable to their
fellow Christians in that neighbourhood; though the
Lord, by this step, was preparing them for spheres of
usefulness in another direction, and the great Bishop
of Souls soon found employment for both of them.
This friend of Mr. Raban's was Mr. Perry, who
afterwards became minister at Wollaston.</p>

<p>When Mr. Raban had accepted the invitation to
Yardley, he was much devoted to the spiritual interests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
of his flock; but having a numerous family, he
continued at Olney, following his occupation as a
mechanic or builder. This enabled him to serve his
flock with scarcely any reward but their affections
and their prayers. In addition to his labours at
Yardley, he preached lectures in different places; and
it is worthy of remark, that he was the first Dissenting
minister who established a lecture at Woburn, Bedfordshire,
where there is now a settled congregation.</p>

<p>Several remarkable escapes from danger and death
were experienced by Mr. Raban. On one occasion,
being in an unfinished building two stories high, his
foot slipped and he fell to the ground and pitched upon
an axe, the edge of which stood upright; it cut his hat,
but missed his head, and he sustained little or no injury.
At another time, a large piece of timber, on which
he had set his foot, heaved up and fell with him into
a saw-pit, and an anvil of a hundred pounds' weight,
connected with the wood, fell upon him; but it only
bruised his leg, which was soon healed. There was
another still more remarkable preservation which he
had to record. As he was assisting in raising a beam
in a mill, the rope slipped, when the beam, under which
he stood, fell with him from a height of four stories;
but though much injured by the fall, his life was
wonderfully preserved. At another time, he was
driving a team with a load of hay down a narrow lane,
when, by attempting to get on the other side of the
waggon, he was thrown under the wheel; but he had
the presence of mind to call to the horses to stop,
which they did in a moment, and thus he was once
more saved from instantaneous death. Such deliverances
must have deeply affected the heart of a good
man, and have led him with some deep emotion to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
with the Psalmist, "who redeemeth our life from
destruction." But within the last month of his existence,
the truth of Cowper's beautiful lines were exemplified&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Safety consists not in escape</span><br />
<span class="i0">From dangers of a frightful shape;</span><br />
<span class="i0">An earthquake may be bid to spare</span><br />
<span class="i0">The man that's strangled by a hair."</span>
</div>

<p>On Lord's-day, May 9th, he was engaged in preaching
at Woburn. After service, when leaving a friend's
house, his foot slipped over a pebble&mdash;he fell, and
found his right leg was broken; and that was the
means of bringing him to the end of his life, on the
31st of the same month.</p>

<p>"In his person," it is said, "Mr. Raban was tall,
being full six feet high, of an athletic habit, and of
regular features. His perceptions were quick, his
memory strong, his spirit ardent and undaunted, mingled
with a good degree of patience and perseverance;
in fine, he enjoyed the union of those good qualities
which rendered his life highly serviceable and honourable
in the situation where infinite wisdom had placed
him."</p>

<p>The Rev. William Bull, of Newport, preached his
funeral sermon, at Yardley, from 2 Chron. xxxii. 33
("And all Judah and Jerusalem did him honour at
his death"), in which he gave the following account of
Mr. Raban's character and ministry:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>It may appear needless for me to dwell upon the character
of your deceased pastor, to persons who have known
him so many years; but I believe very few, except his own
family, were so intimately acquainted with him, either as a
man, a Christian, or a minister. He had long been accustomed
to open his mind freely to me; and I have remarked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
that those who best knew him esteemed him most; so I am
conscious the more I saw of his heart the stronger affection
I felt for him. Few persons have filled up a greater variety
of relations in life than our departed friend. Early habituated
to business, his increasing family and peculiar circumstances
led him into complicated scenes of worldly engagements,
all of which, to the best of my knowledge, he discharged
with unblemished integrity and uncommon disinterestedness.
In such a situation, I believe, no man ever
lived wholly without censure, much less a real Christian, and
least of all a minister of the Gospel. Envy is sure to attack
such a character on one side or the other. Failings, from
which the best of men are never exempt, are often in such
cases dwelt upon with pleasure, if not magnified with diligence.
However, I can truly say, that scarcely any man I
know had fewer or smaller faults than my late dear friend.
Whatever they were, they may now properly be buried with
him, while his good works, in which he abounded to the
glory of God and the good of men, have followed him to
another world. His disposition as a man was peaceable,
loving, and friendly. His weeping family bear testimony to
his peculiar tenderness and love, both as a husband and
parent. It is my duty to unite with his friends in speaking
of that kindness and disinterestedness with which he administered
every service in his power to all who enjoyed his
familiar friendship. I do not doubt but the town of Olney
will miss and lament him, and so will this Church and congregation;
and I am sure several ministers of the Gospel will
feel the wound deeply.</p>

<p>His hope of salvation was firmly grounded on the Lord
Jesus Christ; his views of the Gospel were evangelical and
clear; his experience deep and lively; and his desires after
real holiness of heart and life were steadfast and influential.
While from the first of his separation from the Established
Church he was conscientious and firm in his dissent, no person
was ever more removed from bigotry towards any party.
He was friendly and affectionate to pious people, and useful
to the encouragement of ministers whose judgment in trivial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
matters differed from his own. Seldom has the loss of one
individual been so deeply and affectionately felt as his will
be, on this account. An earnest desire to be useful to those
about him strongly marked all his actions, whether it respected
their temporal or their spiritual concerns. It is no
wonder, therefore, that he took peculiar delight in preaching
that free grace which he himself had tasted and enjoyed. To
this his congregation can bear a decided testimony; and I
hope, my dear friends, you will prove your love to the Gospel
which so long has been freely preached to you, by your exertions
for its continuance now your worthy pastor is no more.
"Remember him who has had the rule over you, whose faith
follow, considering the end of his conversation." He is gone
to give an account of his ministry; and very soon you must
follow him, to give your account of the use and abuse you have
made of his labours of love. How happy are those who went
before him to glory! and how happy will it be for you, if you
follow after!</p>

<p>As to his family, prudence tenderness and love say, Be
sparing. I commit them all to the support of his Lord and
their Lord, to his God and their God. His dying prayer for
his son in the ministry was, that he might be kept in a
humble and faithful attachment to the truths of the Gospel;
and to this I add my hearty Amen!</p>

<p>Upon the whole, there might be some things in his example
for us to avoid; but I am sure there were many for us to
imitate. His happy spirit is now doubtless before the throne,
enjoying the friendship of his companion and fellow labourer,
Mr. Perry. Now their labours are ended, in the enjoyment
of that "rest which remaineth for the people of God."</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"There, on a green and flowery mount,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Their weary spirits sit,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And with transporting joy recount</span><br />
<span class="i1">The labours of their feet."</span>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>The next minister who was placed over this people
was Mr. John Hoppus, who accepted an invitation to
the pastoral office, and was ordained in May, 1804.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Mr. Hoppus was born in London, 1761; and becoming
early acquainted with real religion, he joined the
Church under the care of the Rev. W. Bennett, Moorfields,
availing himself also, on suitable occasions, of
the pulpit instructions of the Rev. Messrs. Newton
and Romaine; and the Rev. Rowland Hill greatly
attracted his admiration, on account of his fervent and
zealous address. He sympathized with that school of
Christians which sprung from the labours of Whitefield,
whose letters, detailing his labours in Britain
and America, were always perused by Mr. Hoppus
with delight. The very name of their author was
sufficient to animate him to earnest conversation, when
oppressed by bodily affliction and declining years.
Indeed, such was his admiration of the zealous spirit
of Whitefield, as recorded in his history, that to feel
and to express the same sentiment in the hearing of
Mr. Hoppus was one of the readiest avenues to his
friendship. While engaged in business, he became
connected with the London Itinerant Society, preaching
in many places in the vicinity of the metropolis;
and his labours proved very acceptable and useful.
The following remarkable instance is deserving of
notice: "When he was preaching on one occasion at
Lewisham, a lady who through domestic trouble was
resolved on suicide, and was on her way to commit
the deed, passed the door of the place where Mr.
Hoppus was at that moment speaking of the sin of
Judas, who "went out, and hanged himself." Hearing
the preacher's voice, she entered, was much struck
with his earnest manner, and applied the subject to
her own case. She told him, in a subsequent interview,
that he had been the means of saving both body
and soul."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Hoppus at length resigned his business, to
devote himself entirely to the work of the ministry.
He removed to Newport Pagnell, to avail himself of
the advantages of the academical institution there,
under the care of the Rev. W. Bull. While there, he
was highly esteemed by his worthy tutor, his fellow
students, and many of the good people in the town
and neighbourhood.</p>

<p>He had several invitations to the pastoral office, but
declined the others to accept the one he received from
Yardley, though the cause was then in so low a state
that the Church consisted of only nine members, and
the congregation of about forty hearers. But it was
soon found necessary to erect a gallery, and remodel
the interior of the Chapel; and as there was no house
suitable for the minister, a commodious one was erected
adjoining the Chapel, by the liberal permission of the
Marquis of Northampton, the ground landlord.</p>

<p>Mr. Hoppus was a devoted village pastor; he paid
great attention to the young, and a weekly meeting
was held at his house on Saturday evenings, for the
catechetical instruction and the encouragement of those
young persons who appeared religiously disposed. He
excelled in pastoral visitation; was much in the habit
of introducing religious conversation in families, and
in the work-rooms of the lacemakers. He endeavoured
to extend the knowledge of the Gospel to the villages
around him. For many years he preached on stated
evenings in the week at Denton, Easton, and Grendon,
as well as at Yardley, beside visiting other places.
Sometimes he conducted services in the open air. He
had a very happy method of dropping a word of religious
advice to persons whom he accidentally saw at
their worldly calling: in this he was very useful, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
only in conciliating the minds of some, but often of
implanting deep and permanent impressions.</p>

<p>In the year 1813, in the midst of great pastoral
success, a fire broke out, which destroyed many houses
in the village; and the Chapel also was destroyed,
which had stood nearly a century. This grievous trial
would have overwhelmed a mind of less energy and
enterprise, as the people at Yardley were totally unable
to defray the expense of a new building. Mr.
Hoppus, however, immediately set about the arduous
task of appealing to Christian benevolence, and after
many months of unwearied labour raised a sufficient
sum in the adjacent counties and the metropolis to
erect a Chapel of twice the size of the other place. A
gallery was afterwards added, to accommodate a still
increasing congregation.</p>

<p>But during a pastorate of thirty years, he had to
share in some of the trials of the faithful minister. He
often lamented that his hands were not more strengthened
by the conversion to God of such as might have
proved influential in discountenancing vice and immorality
by an exemplary life, in consequence of their
better circumstances. In some cases his fidelity gave
offence.</p>

<p>After having been accustomed, till his seventy-second
year, to preach three times on the Sabbath,
increasing infirmities induced him to resign the pastoral
office. The last time he preached at Yardley was
on May 4th, 1834; and he administered the Lord's
Supper to his late charge only a few weeks before his
death.</p>

<p>In the latter years of his life Mr. Hoppus often
appeared to enjoy much happiness in religion, and
when unable to sleep would speak much and fervently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
of the great truths of the Gospel, and the glorious
anticipations of believers. He would repeat many
Scripture passages and hymns from which he derived
comfort and edification. It was often evident to those
around him that his mind was maturing for the great
and blissful change that awaited him. He had recovered
from an attack of indisposition, and still
appeared to retain a portion of the vigour of his naturally
fine constitution. On the 30th of August, 1837,
he had taken some exercise in his garden, and in the
evening had prayed in his family as usual; but he had
not long retired to rest before he was heard to breathe
deeply twice, apparently in sleep. His appearance
indicated what proved to be the event. Medical aid
was called in, but the vital spark had fled. Thus, in
his seventy-seventh year, did this servant of God
obtain what he had for years desired might be granted
him in death, "an easy dismission."</p>

<p>Mr. Hoppus was interred in the burial-ground of
the Chapel. The funeral sermon was preached, according
to the long expressed wish of the deceased,
by his esteemed friend, the Rev. T. P. Bull, from a
text chosen by himself&mdash;1 Cor. xv. 58.</p>

<p>Mr. Hoppus's labours were eminently disinterested.
"I have stated," said Mr. Bull, in his sermon, "that
he was in business seven years; and, successful as he
was, when his industry, perseverance, and talents for
business are considered, if he had continued in it he
might have accumulated much wealth. But it was
not his object to seek that which has been the ruin of
so many; and at Yardley you have seen, my friends,
that he 'sought not yours, but you.' As to his life,
it is unnecessary to say anything, for you all know
his consistency. His views of the Gospel were clear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
His religion was that of the heart: it was sterling,
rational, and practical, and influenced his life and conduct.
He 'travailed in birth for souls.' When he
came to Yardley, the place of worship was small, the
Church was small, and there was no minister's house.
He enlarged the Chapel, built the house; and when
the Chapel was burned down, he accomplished the
laborious task of collecting, and built this commodious
place." "What he did for the cause of Christ at Yardley
will remain as his monument to future times."</p>

<p>These particulars are taken from an account written
by Mr. Hoppus's only daughter. His only son is Professor
Hoppus, of the London University.</p>

<p>After Mr. Hoppus had resigned the pastoral office,
the Rev. J. Bunn succeeded him, commencing his
stated labours in January, 1834. He removed to
Abergavenny, in Wales, in 1838. During the ministry
of Mr. Bunn, two new galleries were added to the
Chapel.</p>

<p>The Rev. James Spong, of Newport Pagnell Academy,
succeeded Mr. Bunn, becoming pastor in October,
1838. He resigned about the end of 1840.</p>

<p>The Rev. William Todman, the present pastor, took
the oversight of the Church and congregation and commenced
his labours on the 5th of June, 1842. During
the ten years that have elapsed since then, the large
and convenient school-rooms have been built adjoining
the Chapel, at a cost of nearly 400. In the daily
Infant-school there are upwards of 80 children, and in
the Sabbath-school 260. Many additions have been
made to the Church, and the congregations never
were better than at the present time. The number of
communicants is about 116. Occasional services are
conducted in the villages in the vicinity of Yardley.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>The state of this interest shows what may be done,
under the divine blessing, to sustain and advance a
Christian society on voluntary principles, in a situation
of not the most promising character, by men of a
devoted spirit, concerned to promote the glory of the
Saviour and the welfare of immortal minds.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>MEMORIALS OF THE INDEPENDENT CHURCH AT
KILSBY AND CRICK.</h3>


<p>The Independent congregation in these places owes
its origin, there is reason to conclude, to the labours
of ministers ejected by the Act of Uniformity. Mr.
Worth, who had been vicar of Kilsby, and Mr. Stephen
Fowler, who had been rector of Crick, were useful
here, after their ejectment. Concerning the former,
Palmer states "that he preached for a while, as a
Nonconformist, at Daventry and Chipping Norton";
on other authority it is stated that "he also continued
to labour at Kilsby." Of the latter we are informed,
that "after leaving the Church at Crick, he came to
reside at Kilsby; and that, after attending the services
of the Church in the day, he repeated a sermon in his
own house, in the evening of the Sabbath, to such as
chose to attend." The labours of these two devoted
ministers of Christ were rendered useful to several
families in the village, so that they became attached to
the preaching of the Gospel and to the mode of conducting
religious worship as it was practised among
the Nonconformists.</p>

<p>Of Mr. Worth it is stated that "he had three sons,
ministers among the Dissenters"; of Mr. Fowler, that
"his rectory at Crick was very valuable, but it proved
no temptation to him to conform against his conscience."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
He was a very popular preacher, and indefatigable
in his labours. He died through an excess
of hard study and too frequent preaching, as he went
to Newbury upon the removal of Mr. John Woodbridge,
who was ejected there. We are informed that
"he was eminent for the holiness of his life, his zeal
and constancy in his work at all times, his great moderation,
and many other excellent qualities."</p>

<p>There was also a Mr. Richard Thorpe, ejected from
Barby, a village about a mile from Kilsby. Such was
his high attainment in the exercise of prayer, that none
of the ministers in those parts were thought to excel him.
The youth of the village stood in great awe of him, so
as to be kept from profaning the Sabbath, as had been
too common there. He was so much taken up with
spiritual things, that he left all his worldly concerns to
the care of a faithful servant. After his ejectment, he
preached in his own house on Thursdays without
molestation.</p>

<p>The separation of these eminent men from the Established
Church, and their labours in this vicinity,
were the means of bringing some to be decided Nonconformists;
but their number for many years was too
small to constitute a separate Church, for the support
of a pastor, so that they travelled on the Sabbath to
attend the Dissenting ministry at Long Buckby and
Daventry, and invited the ministers of these places to
preach a week-day lecture at Kilsby, in a house licensed
for this purpose. Their numbers gradually increased;
the room became too small for them; they purchased
another house, and fitted it up as a place to be appropriated
to religious worship. This was in the year
1738. When this was done, the ministers of Daventry
and Buckby engaged to preach to them alternately on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
the Sabbath morning. The number of hearers still increased,
so that early in the year 1750 they built a
gallery for the further accommodation of the people.</p>

<p>At this time they had attained to such a degree of
strength as to indulge the thought of having a stated
pastor over them. In the latter part of this year, with
the hearty concurrence of the ministers by whom the
lecture had been preached, they invited Mr. Thomas
Strange to minister amongst them, with a view to a
settlement. After a suitable trial, the following invitation
to the pastoral office was presented to him:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><div class="signature">
<i>Kilsby, June 1st, 1752.</i>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear and Reverend Sir</span>,&mdash;We, a Church of Protestant
Dissenters in and near this place, have through a remarkable
kind providence enjoyed the benefit of your labours
for upwards of twelve months to our entire satisfaction, and
we hope, through the blessing of God, to our advantage.
And, sir, as your religious sentiments, piety, zeal, and ministerial
ability afford an encouraging prospect of your usefulness,
it appears to us very desirable that you would now,
sir, enter into the relation of a pastor to us, in which request
you may depend upon our unanimity, and our endeavour to
make your situation comfortable and useful, by our constant
prayers and all other means proper to us as private Christians,
who are, sir, your cordial friends and most humble
servants. (Signed by thirty-two names.)</p></blockquote>

<p>This invitation Mr. Strange accepted; and though
the numbers, the place of worship, and the accommodations
he found were unusually defective, yet he
went with the noble resolution of exerting all his
powers for the increase and improvement of his
humble charge; and his exertions were uncommonly
great, prudent, and successful.</p>

<p>Mr. Strange was born at Evenley, in the county of
Northampton. When he was about six years of age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
his father was removed by death; but the father had
discerned in his son, at that early age, such a thoughtful
spirit as led him to express a wish that he might
in after life become a Christian minister. As he
grew up, to obtain good books was his greatest aim;
and when he had obtained a new one, he would
scarcely allow himself time for his meals. He would
conduct family worship at sixteen years of age, with
great seriousness and propriety. On the family removing
to Shelston, near Buckingham, he formed
an intimate acquaintance with Mr. Boughton, afterwards
a fellow student with him, and subsequently
minister at Buckingham. These two friends, in the
ardour of their youthful zeal, walked ten miles on
the Lord's-day to hear Mr. Haywood, of Potterspury,
and became members of his Church. Mr. Strange
felt a great desire to be devoted to the work of the
ministry, but could see no prospect of attaining that
desire. But his mother mentioned the subject to Mr.
Hayward; he introduced it to Dr. Doddridge, who,
with his usual generosity and zeal, kindly engaged
to procure for such a youth all necessary supplies
during his academical course. He entered the academy
at Northampton in 1745, and continued there
for six years, and then entered on his ministry at
Kilsby, where he pursued his labours as a Christian
pastor till near the end of his days.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>An unhappy peculiarity in the elocution and gesture
of Mr. Strange in the pulpit prevented the popularity
to which his other excellencies entitled him; but
these defects became so annihilated to his stated
hearers by nobler impressions, that they were surprised
when strangers were disgusted by them. He
generally preached twice at Kilsby and once at Crick
on the Lord's-day, and conducted a fourth service
either at Barby or Hillmorton, having also to walk
about eight miles. The congregations increased under
him, so that in two years after his settlement they
were obliged to erect two new galleries in the house
at Kilsby. In the year 1763 they found it necessary
to build a new place of worship. Towards this object
they subscribed liberally, for their circumstances,
raising amongst themselves 170; and by means of an
appeal to other congregations, their plan of building a
place at a cost of 400 was accomplished. A plain,
commodious, and substantial Meeting House was erected.
A few years after, finding the private room in which
the meetings at Crick were held very strait and inconvenient,
out of an estate settled by Mr. Henfrey on
the Dissenting Society Mr. Strange erected a small but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
decent place of worship there, and about the same time
purchased a cottage at Hillmorton, and fitted it up for
the same purpose.</p>

<p>The people purchased the premises adjoining the
Chapel for a dwelling-house for their minister, which,
by Mr. Strange's skill and industry, were greatly improved.
He was one of the most useful and one of
the most noble-hearted of village pastors; he catechised
the young people of his charge, he visited the
afflicted and tried, he kept a Day-school for the benefit
of the rising generation, the profits of which he devoted
to pious and charitable purposes. As his own family
grew up, he admitted six boarders to his house, at
twelve guineas per annum and one guinea entrance.
Frugality, neatness, and hospitality, were never more
perfectly united than in his dwelling. A salary of
40, with the interest of 300, and some occasional
benefactions, would hardly admit of a hired servant;
Mrs. Strange, therefore, and her daughters, managed
the whole business of the family (washing and brewing
not excepted), with admirable ease and regularity.
Whoever entered, or at whatever hour, no dshabill,
either in the house or inhabitants, no confusion or
bustle, was perceived, nor any want of decent accommodation
or cordial welcome. No time, no money
was wasted; and by this means, little as they possessed
of either, they always had some of each to spare at
the call of indigence, friendship, or civility. No
worthy supplicant or proper visitor left the house complaining;
yea, the most concealed wants or distresses
of their neighbours seldom escaped the kind vigilance
of its inhabitants, or were suffered to remain without
some endeavour to alleviate them. Yet, with all this
kindness, Mr. Strange found every year a surplus to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
add to the little stock reserved for his family. He has
often been heard to say, "that though when single he
could scarcely make both ends meet, since his marriage
he had been able to save a few shillings." A higher
compliment to Mrs. Strange he could not easily have
paid. Indeed, that management must have been truly
astonishing, which out of his income, and with his
liberality, could lay by, in no long course of years,
several hundred pounds for his widow and his four
children. The authors of the 'History of Dissenters'
say, "let it not be supposed that this was the fruit
of niggardly penury; the man was liberal, and had the
spirit of a prince."</p>

<p>He took time by the forelock. On a Monday,
though his Sabbath was a laborious day in travelling
and preaching, it was his custom to rise an hour or
two before the family, to draw out the schemes of his
intended discourses on the ensuing Sabbath, as a
directory to his thoughts, reading, and conversation
through the week.</p>

<p>When he was getting near to his sixtieth year, his
strength greatly declined, and he felt that his end was
drawing nigh. In his last affliction he said to some of
his brethren who accidentally met at his house, "I
have always valued and preached the doctrine of grace,
but nothing gives me so much concern, on a review of
my ministry, as that I have no more insisted upon and
pressed the fruits of grace." When all united in
their testimony to the practical strain of his preaching,
he added, "as death and eternity draw nigh, I
see more than ever I did before the infinite importance
of these fruits, and the comparative insignificance
of all opinions without them." As to the person of
Christ, he desired his flock might be assured that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
"he died in a firm belief that Jesus Christ was
the true and proper Son of God, in whom dwelt all
the fulness of the Godhead bodily; a doctrine," he
added, "which I firmly believe, but do not attempt to
explain." "I wish to die," he said on another occasion,
"a broken-hearted sinner, renouncing everything
of my own, and depending entirely for future happiness
on the free grace of God, through the atonement and
righteousness of Christ." His last words to his surrounding
friends were, "Farewell, till the day of the
Lord Jesus. The Lord have mercy, spiritual and
eternal mercy, on every one of you, upon this congregation,
and upon the whole Israel of God. The Lord
gave, and the Lord hath a right to take away; blessed
be the name of the Lord!" He died September 1st,
1784, aged sixty years.</p>

<p>Thus lived and died the first pastor of the Independent
Church at Kilsby.</p>

<p>Concerning his death, the historians before referred
to, say&mdash;"the tears and groans of his flock attested the
greatness of their loss: it would be, indeed, a less difficult
task to find a suitable successor to the see of Canterbury,
than to the village of Kilsby." Subsequent
events indicate that there is considerable truth in this
statement; for though sixty-eight years have passed
since the death of Mr. Strange, and Kilsby has had
in that period pastors of varied excellence and usefulness,
not one has yet been found to live, and labour,
and die amongst them after the manner of the first
pastor.</p>

<p>The noble-spirited village pastor's wife is worthy of
a short record, as we find the following notice of her
death, written by the Rev. H. Knight, of Yelvertoft:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p><blockquote><p>December 12th, 1819, died at Yelvertoft, in the county of
Northampton, aged 84, Dorothy, the widow of the late Rev.
Thomas Strange, many years Protestant Dissenting minister
at Kilsby. She was "an Israelite indeed, in whom there was
no guile." To the last she manifested an ardent attachment
to the Redeemer, and a great delight in the ordinances of
religion. As her course was holy, so it pleased God that her
end should be peaceful. Under the most severe affliction,
which terminated her life, she was supported by those words&mdash;"The
Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear?
the Lord is the strength of my life, of whom shall I be afraid?"
from which Mr. Knight preached her funeral sermon. Knowing
in whom she believed, and longing to depart that she
might be with Christ, she sweetly breathed her spirit into
his hands. Her truly amiable spirit, unaffected piety, exemplary
conduct, and Christian benevolence, endeared her to all
who knew her. "The righteous shall be had in everlasting
remembrance."</p></blockquote>

<p>The records of this Church have not been to any
extent preserved, so that the numbers that entered
into communion during the ministry of Mr. Strange
cannot be ascertained; and the names of the subsequent
pastors, with the date of their ministry, constitute
nearly all that can be now presented.</p>

<p>Mr. Jacob Harwood was ordained here in 1786.
He removed to the neighbourhood of Leeds. Mr. H.
Gritten was pastor in 1790. Mr. Thomas Gardiner
was the next minister, and he left in 1794. Mr.
Morrell came in November of that year, and left
at Midsummer, 1799. Mr. Thomas Spencer came
at Michaelmas in that year, and left in 1805. Mr.
Thomas Jones almost immediately succeeded, and removed
in 1811. Mr. Morgan followed Mr. Jones,
and continued until 1824. Two or three ministers
occupied the pulpit successively until 1827. On
the 28th of June in that year Mr. Thomas Porter was
ordained. Mr. Porter was from the academy at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
Hackney: at his ordination, Mr. Pinkerton, of Weedon,
prayed and read the Scriptures; Mr. Griffiths, of
Buckby, delivered the introductory discourse; Mr.
Hobson, of Welford, offered the ordination prayer;
Mr. Collison, Mr. Porter's tutor, delivered the charge;
Mr. Scott, of Rowell, preached to the people.</p>

<p>Mr. Porter resigned his charge at Kilsby, Nov.
10th, 1839, and removed to Godalming, in Surrey.</p>

<p>Mr. James Rees Jones accepted the pastoral charge,
and was ordained June 18th, 1840. He removed to
Bolton, in Lancashire, in 1851.</p>


<div class="center">CRICK.</div>

<p>The connexion between the congregations at Kilsby
and Crick continued until the removal of Mr. Morgan,
in the year 1824, when fifteen members resident in
Crick separated themselves from the Church at Kilsby;
and early in 1825 Mr. Bicknell, formerly of Welford,
became their pastor. During his ministry, which continued
for fourteen years, twenty-three members were
added to the Church. He resigned, in consequence of
age and infirmity, in 1838.</p>

<p>Mr. Cuzens, the next pastor, commenced his ministry
in July of the same year, and left in October,
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '1831'">1841</ins>. He admitted eight members to the Church.</p>

<p>Mr. Hall, who succeeded Mr. Cuzens, came in January,
1842, and resigned in September, 1850, removing
to Rugeley, in Staffordshire. Twenty-eight members
were admitted during the ministry of Mr. Hall.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Islip, late of Stamford, ministered here
from May, 1851, to January, 1852; since that time,
supplies have been obtained. The present number of
members is 37. There are 35 children in the Sabbath-school.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>MEMORIALS OF THE INDEPENDENT CHURCH AT
BRIGSTOCK.</h3>


<p>In the village of Brigstock, which contains upwards
of 1200 inhabitants, an Independent Church was
formed about seventy-four years ago. There was a
small band of decided Christians, attached to the principles
of Nonconformity, who in the year 1778 united
together in the faith of the Gospel, to sustain a Christian
ministry and to have the ordinances of Christ
administered unto them. This took place with the
encouragement and advice of some ministers of Christ
in their vicinity, who had occasionally preached unto
them, and knew the circumstances in which they were
placed; but there are some interesting memorials
preserved of events which preceded, and which manifestly
prepared the way, under the blessing of the
great Head of the Church, for the formation of a
regular Christian society in this place.</p>

<p>It is stated on satisfactory evidence, that during the
time of the Plague in London, a godly tradesman of
the name of Leigh retired to this village; and it
appears that the piety of this Christian and his family,
with the attention they paid to the means of grace
among the Nonconformists of the neighbourhood, at
Kettering, or at Rowell, with whom they for many
years became identified, was gradually the means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
awakening the attention of others to the subject of
true religion and to the cause of Nonconformity. This
presents us with a pleasing example of the useful
influence that may be exerted by a Christian household,
in exciting attention to the means of grace and
the principles of the Gospel in a benighted neighbourhood.
As their numbers increased, they attended at
different places around them, as it might suit their
convenience or their taste, those places being from
eight to thirteen miles distant; some of them becoming
decided Christians, they united in Christian fellowship
with those Churches where they generally attended.
Thus things continued until the days of Doddridge's
ministry, when some stated services were commenced
at Brigstock, of which the following account has been
preserved:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Many in this place, several years ago, were very desirous of
having the Gospel preached amongst them, as they are six
miles from Oundle, eight from Kettering, nine from Rowell,
and ten from Wellingborough,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and have bad roads all around
us; consequently old people, and such as have large families,
could seldom hear the word, these being the nearest places in
which it was preached. Therefore they made their case
known to the Rev. Mr. Doddridge, and by his means obtained
an exhibition from the Independent Fund for the support of
a monthly week-day lecture, which was preached for some
time by the following ministers, viz.: Messrs. Doddridge,
Saunders, Boyce, Hextal, Haywood, and Grant. A blessing
attended the word; our numbers greatly increased; many joyfully
received the Gospel, and became very desirous of hearing
it, if possible, on a Lord's-day. They entered into a subscription
for a lecture once a month on Lord's-day, which was the
means of enlarging our interest still more. We continued in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
this state many years, till, having many that we hoped had received
the grace of God, we began to think of embodying into
a Church, and had it recommended to us by the ministers that
used to attend our lecture, especially the Rev. Mr. Addington,
who, being providentially cast amongst us for the first time
about the year 1774, talked with us particularly upon this subject.
What he said appeared to rest on many minds, and convinced
us that it was our duty to attend on all the ordinances
of Christ: we therefore sought direction and assistance from
God in prayer; and after watching for some time the openings
of providence, Mr. Hillyard, a member of the Church at
Wellingborough, under the pastoral care of Mr. Carver, was
recommended as a proper person to be our minister. We
took opportunities of hearing him often; and it being always
to our satisfaction, we applied to him to come amongst us.
We first invited him for a quarter of a year, and when that
was expired, for a year, fully approving his gifts and his general
views of Christian doctrine and discipline. Thereupon,
being desirous to honour Christ, as King and Head of the
Church, and to testify our allegiance to him; in hope likewise
of the fulfilment of his promise, "Where two or three are
gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of
them," we desire to give up ourselves and ours to the Lord,
to be ruled by his laws and to attend all his ordinances,
agreeable to our confession of faith and Church covenant.
And after having given ourselves to the Lord, we also give
ourselves to one another, by a declaration of God's dealings
with us, in a meeting appointed for that purpose, and the
mutual giving and receiving the right hand of fellowship.</p>

<p>Witness our hands, the 4th of March, 1778. (Here follow
the names of ten brethren.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Then, in their Church covenant drawn up and subscribed
June 9th of the same year, they say&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>We, the professed disciples of Christ, whose names are hereunto
subscribed, meeting together for the worship of God in
Brigstock, having long enjoyed the means of grace through
the favourable indulgence of God towards us, cannot think it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
will be for the glory of God to continue any longer as scattered
individuals, like lambs in a large place, but judge it
our duty, both from the openings of providence and from
rules lying before us in God's word, to cleave to him with
fuller purpose of heart than heretofore we have done, each
one for ourselves, and, in the judgment of charity, each one
hoping well for each other; and having given ourselves to the
Lord, in a perpetual covenant that shall never be forgotten,
do here, in the presence of God, angels, and men as our witnesses,
give each other the right hand of fellowship, binding
ourselves by covenant and by oath to walk together according
to that order which is, for distinction sake, called Congregational,
according to the Abrahamic covenant, including
believers and their children, which we find pointed out to us
in the New Testament by our Lord Jesus Christ and his holy
apostles. Having thus covenanted together under Christ our
Sovereign Lord and Head, we look upon it our duty to him
solemnly to engage, in his strength, to maintain those truths
which are essential to real Christianity, against all opposers
whatever, at the expense of our properties and our lives, if
God in his providence should call and strengthen us so to do.</p>

<p>(Then follow the articles of their faith.)</p></blockquote>

<p>In reference to the commencement of Mr. Hillyard's
ministry, who was the first pastor of this Church at
Brigstock, we find the following records preserved by
the Church at Wellingborough, of which he was a
member:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>March 2nd, 1775.</i>&mdash;The Church was informed that brother
Hillyard had given an exhortation to some of the brethren,
who should report to the Church their thoughts next meeting.</p>

<p><i>May 5th.</i>&mdash;Brother Hillyard exercised his gift before the
Church, when it was unanimously agreed that he should continue
until the path of duty was more plain.</p>

<p>In 1776, <i>June 6th</i>, the Church met by appointment, and
sent brother Hillyard to preach whithersoever the Lord is
pleased to call him.</p>

<p>In 1778, <i>May 3rd</i>, a letter was read from Brigstock, saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
that they had formed themselves into a Church, and requested
that we would send messengers to behold their faith and order,
on the 9th of June. That Church afterwards agreed, by the
advice of ministers, to invite brother Hillyard to be ordained
their pastor, and for this purpose requested his dismission.</p>

<p>He was ordained May 20th, and on this occasion Mr. Toller,
of Kettering, Mr. Robins, and Mr. Toller, of London, preached.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of Mr. Hillyard's early ministrations it is stated,
"that they were distinguished by a glowing, holy, and
enlightened zeal, accompanied with great modesty and
diffidence. He was fully sensible of the disadvantages
under which he laboured for want of a more liberal
education, yet earnestly desirous of devoting all that
he had attained, all that he possessed, to the good of
souls and the furtherance of the Gospel. With much
regret he was compelled to relinquish his station at
Brigstock, on account of the inability of the people to
meet the wants of his increasing family. He then
settled for a few years at Kimbolton, in Huntingdonshire,
until he fixed for the remainder of his life at
Olney, in Buckinghamshire, where during forty years
he experienced the great goodness of his God and
Saviour. He fell asleep on the twelfth of July, 1828,
in the eighty-third year of his age. His address was
plain, powerful, and pointed. His ministry was abundantly
blessed; his place of worship at Olney was
enlarged four times."</p>

<p>An unsettled interval, attended with repeated changes,
appears to have followed Mr. Hillyard's removal. A
Mr. Griffin appears immediately to have succeeded Mr.
Hillyard; then Mr. Maurice Phillips was placed here
for a short time&mdash;he came in the year 1790, when this
place became united with Weldon, under one pastor:
Mr. Phillips afterwards became tutor of Rotherham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
College, in connexion with Dr. Williams. Mr. Morgan,
from Dr. Williams' academy, was a candidate for one
year (1796); Mr. William Bull, for nine months; Mr.
Spencer also ministered unto them for one year (1798).
About the year 1798 we read, "that Mr. Mitchel was
universally approved of, and about being settled with
us; but he removed to Leicester, and the hopes of the
people were disappointed." It does not appear that any
person was settled long as pastor for a number of years.
This undoubtedly had a very unfavourable influence
as to the numbers in Church fellowship, for the next
pastor observes, when he first admitted four members
to the Church, "for nearly twenty years there had
been no addition to the little band, the result probably
of being without a pastor." "The number of communicants
at the time of my first dispensing the Lord's
Supper was only five, and two of them were members
of another religious community. The members of the
Church were reduced to eight only, and for some reasons
three did not unite with us at the table. O thou
Spirit Divine, carry on the work of salvation, that many
may first give themselves to the Lord, and then unto
us for Christ's sake! 'By whom shall Jacob arise, for
he is small, but by thee, O Lord?'" Again he wrote&mdash;"With
gratitude I now look back nine years, and
with holy joy my heart exclaims, What has God
wrought, through whose blessing the Church has increased
to upwards of sixty members! This is the
Lord's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes."</p>

<p>Thus wrote Mr. Robert Pickering, who was the next
that was settled over them as a minister of Christ.</p>

<p>But during this unsettled interval, a new Meeting
House was built. A statement of their case was drawn
up, sanctioned by the names of a number of ministers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
soliciting aid from the Churches towards this object,
dated 1798. In this document they say&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>We now have stated supplies, in hopes that the great Head
of the Church will send us a pastor that will go in and out
before us, and feed our souls with spiritual food. Our numbers
being increased to about two hundred, the place which
has been rented about fifty years being very small, and we
being only tenants at will and under a discharge to quit at
Lady-day next, we have been under the necessity of purchasing
a house, with ground to it sufficient for the purpose
of erecting a new place for public worship, on which we have
built a shell, the walls of stone, and covered with slate, to
finish which in a plain comfortable manner will cost in the
whole expense about 300. We are not able to raise more
than 100 amongst ourselves, there being no individual belonging
to the congregation of independent fortune; therefore
we are obliged to make our case known, and to request
the assistance of our friends of other congregations.</p></blockquote>

<p>By the assistance rendered the building was completed,
and the expense ultimately cleared.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1803 that Mr. Pickering, who
had been a student at Rotherham College, was introduced
to the notice of the congregation at Brigstock;
and after ten months' probation, he was publicly ordained
to the pastoral office.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickering was born at Ashby-de-la-Zouch, in
the county of Leicester, March 12th, 1777. His
entrance into a state of spiritual life he dates about
the spring of 1794, when he says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>It pleased God to convert me to himself under a sermon
preached by the Rev. Mr. Moseley, from Matt. vii. 21: "Not
every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father
that is in heaven." I have not much recollection of what
was said, but remember that such was the impression made
upon my mind that I was much affected: on reaching home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
I walked about the garden in much distress. When I reflected
upon that heaven of which I had been hearing, I could
not help exclaiming, "I shall never reach there." Alarmed
at my dreadful state as a sinner, I began to seek after God by
prayer and a more constant attendance at the Chapel, and
eagerly sought every opportunity of pouring out my heart
before him in the closet, the shop, or the field. Nor was it
long before God was pleased to break in upon my soul with
light and comfort. Soon after, I found great encouragement
in a discourse from John vi. 37: "Him that cometh unto me,
I will in no wise cast out." My experience at that time was
not the same as many of God's people. I had not that horror,
darkness, and awful dread which some have passed through.
No, blessed be Immanuel! he "drew me with the cords of a
man, and with bonds of love."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Pickering became a member of the Church at
Atherstone, where he then resided; and soon after this
he began to engage in occasional religious services for
the benefit of others; and on the 29th of August, 1798,
he entered the academy at Rotherham. On the completion
of his studies he laboured for a year at Driffield,
in Yorkshire; but difficulties arose, which rendered
it unsuitable for him to remain. He was invited
on probation by the people at Brigstock. "I selected,"
he says, "as the ground of my first address to the
congregation of Brigstock, Rom. i. 16: 'I am not
ashamed of the Gospel of Christ.' To the speaker it
was a merciful season, and a time of saving impression
to a person who afterwards joined the Church of
Christ. In the afternoon I preached at Weldon, and
in the evening at Corby." These places combined in
promoting the temporal support of the same minister,
while they mutually reaped the benefit of his pious
labours. For the first twenty years of his ministry
Mr. Pickering preached statedly at Brigstock and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
Weldon every Lord's-day, and once a month, in the
evening, at Corby also.</p>

<p>On the 21st of June, 1804, he was ordained to the
pastoral office. "The religious services of the day,"
he observes, "were very impressive, and highly interesting.
The brethren engaged were Messrs. Toller,
Whitehead, Gronow, Bullock, Wood, Spencer, and
Chadwick." "The day after my ordination, a deep
sense of the important work and awful responsibility
of the ministry induced me to cry to God for assistance,
that he would cheer me with his presence and
assist me on all occasions. The care of the Church
was much upon my spirit, and the eternal welfare of
souls before me. How weighty the charge! how weak
the instrument! and how arduous the employment!
Oh, to be spiritually minded, watchful, and useful!
Lord, form my mind to bear all the trials and duties
of my station, and thine shall be the praise!"</p>

<p>Mr. Pickering's labours were continued here for
thirty-three years. He was the pious, affectionate,
kind, amiable, and faithful pastor of the village Church.
He had, on the whole, a peaceful and useful course;
always plain and serious, evangelical and devout, in his
engagements as a minister, while his daily temper and
conduct recommended the Gospel he preached. He
died suddenly, August 27th, 1836. He was interred in
the front of the Chapel where he had so long preached.
Mr. Green, of Uppingham, delivered the funeral oration;
Mr. Renals, of Wellingborough, who had been a
fellow student with Mr. Pickering, preached the funeral
sermon, from John xi. 16: "Let us also go, that we
may die with him." Mr. Renals prepared and published
a memoir of his friend. On his last birth-day,
Mr. Pickering wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><div class="center">
<i>March 12th, 1836.</i>
</div>

<p>I am this day fifty-nine years of age. I was nineteen when
I began to exhort my fellow sinners residing in villages to
think of God; and two years after, the Christian Church procured
admission for me at Rotherham College; so that I must
have been engaged, more or less, about forty years in the work
of the Lord. All these years I have found him a good Master&mdash;a
friend near at hand, ever ready to help, and a constant
refuge to my soul; still employing me in hoary age, and rendering
my services somewhat useful in his cause.</p></blockquote>

<p>When Mr. Pickering was settled, a new gallery was
erected; and in the course of his ministry, in the year
1819, a large vestry, measuring 20 feet by 17 feet,
with a school-room of equal size over it, and both opening
into the Meeting House, were added, to accommodate
the young and the poor. The Meeting House,
the vestry, and school-room together, are calculated to
accommodate 450 persons.</p>

<p>On the death of Mr. Pickering, the destitute and
afflicted people applied to Rotherham, and Mr. Isaac
Vaughan came on probation, respecting whose introduction
to Brigstock the following is recorded:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Isaac Vaughan, having been invited by the Church and
congregation at Brigstock, and having visited the place, entered
upon his labours the third Sabbath in July, 1837. His
ordination took place on the 2nd of May, 1838, when a very
large concourse of people assembled, and a goodly company of
ministers, many of whom were called upon to take part in the
services. Mr. Thomas Toller delivered a most beautiful introductory
discourse; Mr. H. Stowell, Mr. Vaughan's tutor,
gave an interesting and impressive charge; Mr. J. Green
offered the ordination prayer; and Mr. E. T. Prust preached
to the Church and congregation a very appropriate sermon.
The services were peculiarly solemn and interesting, and the
impression good.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the spring of 1841, after four short years, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
Vaughan saw fit to remove to Olney (subsequently to
the new Tabernacle, London), and the people were
again as sheep without a shepherd, and were in an unsettled
state for several years. Many supplied the
vacant pulpit, among whom may be mentioned Mr.
Hillyard, since of Pocklington, and Mr. Simpson, now
of Shepton Mallett, both of whom stayed a considerable
time, and were made useful during their temporary
sojourn among the people.</p>

<p>In January, 1845, the cause had become greatly
weakened and the attendance reduced, so that the
spirits of the people were much depressed, when their
attention&mdash;which in 1842 had in vain been directed to
the present minister, Mr. Thomas Lord, then pastor of
the Independent Church at Wollaston&mdash;was again
turned in that direction, and ultimately with success.
He entered upon his labours on the 18th of the following
May. The union was formed under hopeful circumstances,
and has hitherto continued most cordial
and harmonious.</p>

<p>"In the year 1847, being the jubilee of the erection
of the place of worship, it was found needful," states
the present minister, "to effect considerable repairs
and improvements. The people came forward with a
willing mind and a liberal spirit, and raised upwards
of 40, which, with some other donations, was sufficient
to prevent any remaining debt." "There is," he
observes, "no record of members prior to the time of
Mr. Pickering being settled, who, numbering himself
one, entered all those that were in fellowship; and from
that time a record has been kept. The whole number
admitted, up to the present time, has been 201; of these
many have fallen asleep. In the year 1824, seventeen
were dismissed in peace and love, to form a separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
Church of the same order at Weldon. A few have
tired and fainted, and walk the ways of God no more;
some have removed to a distance; while about sixty
remain in communion. The average attendance on
public worship through the year verges upon 300. The
Sunday-schools contain about 110 children, the average
attendance being about seventy each part of the day.
These are attended to by about twenty teachers, who
are most of them on the Lord's side. A separate
service is maintained for the benefit of the children
every Lord's-day, which is conducted by the minister,
deacons, and others in rotation. Several who have
been trained in the schools have become children of
God, but stand connected with other Churches, where
they have been called in the providence of God to
reside.</p>

<p>"There is no pecuniary endowment of any kind in
connexion with the Church at Brigstock, but a good
house erected for the residence of the minister, about
thirteen years ago, upon which there has rested a debt,
which is slowly decreasing, and constitutes the only
difficulty which presses upon the people, who are,
almost without a single exception, working people.
There is no Day-school in connexion with the Chapel,
which is a serious drawback; but the want is partially
met by schoolroom and scholastic privileges which
exist in the village, which, however, through high
Church and Puseyistic influences, are not so efficient
or acceptable as might be.</p>

<p>"On the whole, the Christian friends at Brigstock
have much to be thankful for; and, in language employed
at a late public meeting of the Church and congregation,
minister, and other friends, they say&mdash;'In
looking backward, we cry, "hitherto hath the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
helped us"; and in looking forward, we "thank God and
take courage." In looking inward, we feel that we are
the subject of manifold deficiencies, and confess our
need of a fresh baptism of heavenly and spiritual
blessings; and looking upward, we cry, "O Lord, revive
thy work" "O Lord, we beseech thee, send now
prosperity." Amen.'"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>MEMORIALS OF THE INDEPENDENT CHURCH AT
WELDON AND CORBY.</h3>


<p>In the early part of the last century, there resided
in the village of Little Weldon a freestone mason, Mr.
Edward Nutt, who was a Protestant Dissenter of the
Independent denomination. He usually attended divine
worship at the Independent Meeting in Kettering,
under the ministry of the excellent Mr. Thomas Saunders.
After the death of Mr. Saunders, he travelled
to Oundle on the Sabbath, to hear Mr. Goodrich;
but, not satisfied with going himself to obtain improvement
and enjoyment under the ministry of the
Gospel, he was anxious to bring it home to the inhabitants
of the village in which he resided, with the
hope that it might be rendered useful to them. Therefore,
at the quarter sessions at Northampton, July
17th, 1706, he had his dwelling-house and premises
registered for the worship of God, and then he began
to have occasional preaching there by the Dissenting
ministers in the vicinity. The following copy of the
license granted him has been preserved:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Northamptonshire.</i>
</p>

<p>These are to certify, that Edward Nutt, of the said county,
did certify to her Majesty's justices of the peace, assembled at
their general quarter sessions of the peace, held for the county
aforesaid, on Tuesday, the 16th day of July, that the dwelling-house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
of the said Edward Nutt, with its appurtenances, situated
in Weldon aforesaid, in the said county of Northampton,
is set apart and intended a place of meeting for Protestant
Dissenters to meet for the exercise of their religious worship
and service of God.</p>

<p>Given under my hand, and the seal of my office, this 17th
day of July, anno Domini 1706.</p>

<div class="signature">
<span class="smcap">J. Horton.</span>
</div></blockquote>

<p>In his dwelling-house Mr. Nutt had occasional
services conducted for several years; but about the
year 1736 or 1738 he fitted up, in a very plain manner,
a small barn, where the Meeting House now
stands: it had a small window, a square pulpit, three
stone steps to the pulpit, and the people sat on forms.
Thus it continued, and here the services were held
until the present Meeting House was built.</p>

<p>Mr. Nutt left by will to the Rev. D. Goodrich, of
Oundle, and the Rev. Samuel King, of Welford, his
dwelling-house, with its appurtenances, a close of pasture
land, and one hundred pounds, which they were
to receive at the death of his wife; and Mrs. Nutt
made the same parties joint executors of her will, and
residuary legatees. It was understood that this property
was meant to be applied for the maintenance of
some services in the village of Weldon by Dissenting
ministers. The parties to whom it was left, well knowing
that it was the desire of Mr. and Mrs. Nutt to
have a sermon preached there once a month or oftener,
by Dissenting ministers of the Independent denomination,
consulted with some of the neighbouring ministers
as to the best mode of securing the money for this
purpose. It was ultimately determined to lay it out
in the purchase of a piece of land in Titchmarsh field,
the rents and profits of which continue to be received
towards the support of the minister for the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
being. The dwelling-house was found to expose the
executors to some trouble in obtaining tenants and
keeping it in repair, so that they determined on the
sale of the house, with its appurtenances, for which
they received 80. The half of this sum was expended
in the enclosure of the land at Titchmarsh, and
the other half was applied towards the building of the
new Meeting House. Some years after, the dwelling-house
was again purchased for the residence of the
minister, when they had a settled pastor at Weldon.</p>

<p>While Mr. Nutt was living, his business calling him
very much from home, the services were irregular, being
ordered so as to suit the convenience of Mr. Nutt
and the ministers that he invited to preach: what little
expense was incurred was borne by him. After his
decease, the services were held with greater regularity;
and after the death of Mrs. Nutt, the ministers that
usually preached met annually at Weldon, in July, to
fix the course of lecture for the next year, and audit
the accounts for the last. The plan was, to have a
sermon once a month, on Sabbath evenings, in the
summer, and on Thursday at eleven o'clock <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, in the
winter; and there was seven shillings and sixpence
a time allowed out of the estate and money left by
Mr. and Mrs. Nutt; the surplus paid for a lecture on
other Sabbath evenings, which was usually preached
by Mr. Bacon, pastor of the Independent Church at
Ashley. The preachers of the monthly lecture were
generally the ministers of Oundle, Kettering, Bowell,
Ashley, Harborough, Welford, and Uppingham, all of
whom gave up to Mr. M. Phillips, the minister at
Brigstock, when it was determined to connect Weldon
with that place.</p>

<p>As the lectures could not be much oftener than once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
a month, on the Lord's-day evening; and being in the
forenoon on the week-days, were very thinly attended,
it was considered by the ministers, trustees, and others,
that it would be better for the people at Weldon to
become united with the Church at Brigstock, and so
to get a regularly educated minister between them.
At that time, a Mr. Griffin was minister at Brigstock;
but being seventy-six years of age, he was willing to
retire as soon as the people could obtain a successor.
"Just at that time," writes Mr. Nathaniel Collis, of
Kettering, who felt a lively interest in their concerns,
"I had occasion to write to Dr. Williams, tutor to the
academy, then at Oswestry, and took the opportunity of
inquiring whether any young man was there suitable
for such a situation, on which the Doctor recommended
Mr. Maurice Phillips: he was a Welchman, and came
at the Midsummer vacation, 1790. At first he was a
poor speaker in English, but in a few months so improved
as to become a very acceptable preacher; and he
was a close student." Upon his coming, he regularly
preached at Brigstock and Weldon, so that both places
had preaching once every Sabbath, and sometimes an
additional service in the evening; and he generally
preached once a month at Corby, on a Sabbath evening.
Under these arrangements, the attendance considerably
increased at Weldon. They made some
enlargement of the place of meeting; but the number
of hearers still increasing, and the place being an old
building, low, and inconvenient, they at length determined
on building a new Meeting House. According
to the plan that was formed, it was to be twenty feet
wide, thirty-three feet long, sixteen feet high to the top
of the side walls, and cove of the ceiling about three
feet higher, all inside measure; which, it was thought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
would be large enough to seat them all on the ground
floor, and be high enough for a gallery, if it should be
wanted. The foundation stone was laid May 23rd,
1792. The whole expense of the building was 182.
9<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> All these particulars have been minutely recorded
by Mr. Collis, with the manner in which the
money was obtained, and every donation that was received
for the purpose; and he adds to his account the
following characteristic note: "If the Meeting House
had had but one door, and a much less window, it would
have been better, and saved some pounds in the expense."
But, to his honour be it recorded, he gave a
larger sum towards the building than any other subscriber.
This place continued in connexion with the
Church at Brigstock until the time when Mr. Pickering,
who had for twenty years served both congregations,
determined on confining his labours chiefly to
the latter place. During the ministry of Mr. Pickering,
the Weldon congregation increased; so that it was
thought necessary to erect a gallery across the end of
the Meeting, to face the pulpit, five seats deep, which
was done in the year 1808, at an expense of 39.</p>

<p>About the year 1824, Mr. Pickering resigned his
connexion with Weldon, and the members of the
Brigstock Church residing here received their dismission
to form themselves into a distinct Church of
Christ, when they came to the determination to endeavour
to obtain a stated pastor to reside at Weldon,
and to preach regularly on the Sabbath at Weldon and
Corby. After some time, they gave an invitation to
Mr. John Philip, who became their first pastor here,
and laboured among them about twelve years, and then
was called to close his life suddenly in their service.
One Sabbath morning, while engaged in preaching, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
ruptured a blood vessel, was carried from his pulpit to
his house, and, after a short time, died in his chair.
Mr. Toller, of Kettering, improved his death, from
Zech. i. 5: "The prophets, do they live for ever?"</p>

<p>The next minister was Mr. Moffat, who was with
them but a short time. He was succeeded by Mr.
S. A. Bradshaw. After the removal of Mr. Bradshaw,
an invitation was given to Mr. Thomas Thomas,
from Newport Academy, who became their pastor, and
was ordained May 25th, 1848. The following account
of the ordination service we find in the records of the
Church:&mdash;"On this day," it is stated, "Mr. Thomas
was ordained. Mr. Coleman, of Ashley, commenced by
reading portions of Scripture, and prayer; Mr. Thomas
Toller delivered the introductory discourse, and asked
the questions; Mr. Green, of Uppingham, offered the
ordination prayer; Mr. J. Bull, M.A., of Newport,
delivered the charge; Mr. Robinson, of Kettering,
preached to the people in the evening. The services
were numerously attended, and were peculiarly interesting:
near 300 ministers and friends took tea together,
in a close lent for the purpose. Mr. Robinson
preached in the Chapel close, in the evening; near
upon 500 persons were present, and appeared much
interested with the faithful and appropriate discourse."
Mr. Thomas is still the minister of the congregations
at Weldon and Corby.</p>

<p>The village of Corby is situated about two miles to
the west of Weldon, containing about eight hundred
inhabitants; a small sum of money was given a hundred
years ago for the preaching of a lecture here on a
Sabbath evening by Independent ministers. This
appears to have been first preached by Mr. West, who
was minister at Ashley, and afterwards by Mr. Bacon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
his successor. When the congregation at Weldon
was taken into connexion with the congregation at
Brigstock, the Corby lecture was preached by the
Brigstock minister; but in the year 1824, when it
was determined to have a settled minister at Weldon,
it was agreed that he should preach once every Sabbath
at Corby; and this is the arrangement at the
present time.</p>

<p>About the year 1834, William Rowlatt, Esq., who
was born at Corby, but who was then residing at Burton,
in the parish of Christchurch, in the county of
Southampton,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> anxious to do something for the benefit
of his native place, first erected good school-rooms
for Day-schools of both sexes in Corby and its vicinity,
and liberally endowed them, and gave a dwelling-house
for the teachers. By a deed of gift, they were
transferred to the British and Foreign School Society,
and are placed under the superintendence of a local
Committee. They are efficiently conducted by the
present teachers, Mr. D. Fisher and Miss Ross. The
schools have already proved a great advantage to
Corby and the surrounding villages. Soon after the
schools were erected, the Old Meeting House was
greatly improved, by a new gallery, pews, and pulpit,
at the expense of Mr. Rowlatt; and he has left an
endowment of 500 to be placed on Government
security, the interest to be applied towards the support
of the minister. Whatever opinion may be entertained
as to the principle or the working of endowments for
religious objects, the kindness of Mr. Rowlatt's spirit
and design must be acknowledged, and that hitherto the
result has been good.</p>

<p>There is a Sabbath-school connected with this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
place, consisting of fifty-four children. The school
connected with the congregation at Weldon numbers
twenty-one children. The present number of communicants
is twenty-seven.</p>

<p>In the year 1850, the sum of 55 was left by Mrs.
Mary French, partly for the purpose of renewing the
trust deeds of the minister's house and the close belonging
to this interest, and partly for making improvements
in connexion with the premises. The larger
part of this sum has already been applied according
to the will of the donor.</p>

<p>While we record the pecuniary aid thus afforded to
a small body of Nonconformists in these places, who
have no wealthy individuals amongst them, and who
have to stand against much influence that bears against
the advancement of their principles, we trust it is
ever borne in mind that the promotion of the cause
of pure and undefiled Christianity, the conversion of
sinners unto God, and the advancement of believers in
divine knowledge, faith, holiness, and love, are the
great objects for which a Christian Church is formed
and the ministry of the Gospel sustained. Here may
these objects be abundantly promoted!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3>MEMORIALS OF THE INDEPENDENT CHURCH AT
YELVERTOFT.</h3>


<p>In the village of Yelvertoft, which has a population
of between six and seven hundred inhabitants, there
is a neat Independent Chapel, capable of accommodating
near four hundred persons, situated about the
centre of the village, with school-rooms adjoining.
Passing on to a rather lower part of the village, on
the opposite side may be observed a respectable dwelling-house,
with garden and orchard, which is the residence
of the Independent minister. To be able to go
back to the commencement, and trace the onward progress
of such a cause, thus situated, must be especially
gratifying to those who are now connected with it,
while it might be gratifying to all who take an
interest in the things that relate to the kingdom of
Christ and the highest welfare of men.</p>

<p>It is not more than sixty years since the present
Chapel was erected, an Independent minister regularly
settled as pastor, and a Church formed on Congregational
principles; but in the early part of the last
century, occasional services were conducted here by
Dissenting ministers, chiefly from Welford, where those
residing in Yelvertoft who dissented from the Established
Church were in the habit of attending.</p>

<p>In the book containing the records of the Church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
we find an account of the earliest efforts made by Nonconformists
in this village, and how they led on to the
formation of the present interest. This account we
shall now present to the reader.</p>

<blockquote><p>Some time before any attempt at all was made to introduce
the preached Gospel into this place, and also during the time
that the weekly lectures only were enjoyed, a few persons
were in the habit of going to Welford (about five miles distant),
where they could attend that mode of worship which
appeared to them most agreeable to the word of God; and
there can be little doubt that it was at the suggestion of some
of them that the preaching of the Gospel here was commenced.</p>

<p>When this took place (which must be now, if it occurred
in the time of Mr. Norris, who died in 1738, nearly one hundred
and twenty years ago),<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> a private house was licensed, to
afford the minister at Welford an opportunity to preach a
week-day lecture. It is probable, though difficult to ascertain
with certainty, that Mr. Norris, of Welford, was the first
that ever preached the Gospel in this place amongst Dissenters.
His service consisted of a monthly lecture on a Tuesday afternoon,
which was continued by his successor, the Rev. Samuel
King. The number that usually attended on these occasions
was between twenty and thirty, composed in part of the
revered ancestors of those families that form no small part
of the present congregation.</p>

<p>In the year 1758, a place was fitted up out of an old barn,
in a central part of the village, for the better accommodation
of those who attended. Then it appears, at least towards the
close of Mr. King's service, in addition to the monthly
lecture, the students from the Independent Academy, then
at Daventry, supplied occasionally on the Sabbath-day&mdash;procured,
perhaps, through the instrumentality of Mr. Richard
Norton; and partly from this circumstance, together with
occasional help when it could be had, and the greater convenience
of the place for worship, the congregation gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
increased, notwithstanding the fact that a Dissenting
place of worship was considered by many a degradation, and
the name of Dissenter or Presbyterian, which were confounded
with each other, had considerable odium attached to it. It
is to be observed, however, that the means of grace about
this time were very irregularly enjoyed, for, besides its being
but seldom on the Sabbath, the monthly lecture was continued
only nine months in the year, beginning about the first
Tuesday in October, and continuing till Midsummer. [The
lecture being preached on the afternoon of a week-day, we
suppose they found it necessary to omit the service during the
busy seasons of agriculture, the hay time and the harvest.]</p>

<p>From tradition, which is indeed the chief source whence
this imperfect account has been drawn, it would seem that
the first person who assumed anything like the character of
a settled minister was a Mr. Bryson, the author of a book
explanatory of the 8th chapter of the Epistle to the Romans.
He was one of those ministers the late Countess of Huntingdon
in her liberality provided, as a means in the hands of
Christ to extend his Church. He stayed here about two
years. As her Ladyship had been solicited to permit Mr.
Bryson to continue, he being much approved of after he had
been heard a little while, it is likely that she would consider
herself as bound to attend to the necessities of this place, for
three more gentlemen who were under her directions followed
in succession. The next who succeeded was a Mr.
Green, whose services were enjoyed but one year. After him
followed a Mr. Porter, who, leaving at the expiration of a
year, was succeeded by a Mr. Pritchard, who it seems did not
stay quite one year. These ministers being, as to their personal
expenses, permitted to draw upon their patroness, the
people had only to provide them board and lodging; they
boarded amongst the friends, as circumstances determined.
The labours of these men were followed up by those of a Mr.
Coulson, who divided his attention between Rugby and this
place. He resided some time at Hillmorton, but afterwards
came and lived here, and this place then enjoyed the whole
of his services. He commenced his labours in the year 1783,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
and continued until the year 1788, occupying during his residence
here a house adjoining the premises used as a place of
worship.</p>

<p>About three months after the removal of Mr. Coulson, in
which there was no public worship (an inconvenience which
the cause here had experienced more than once), Mr. Garner,
who properly speaking was settled at Kilsby, preached here
one part of the day for about three months, his services commencing
at Michaelmas and ending at Christmas the same
year. Mr. Jones was the next person who endeavoured to
advance the Redeemer's cause in this place. He lived at
West Haddon, whose services at both places were all which
at the time they enjoyed. He continued in this sphere about
two years&mdash;first preached here in the beginning of the year
1789, and left in November of the year 1790.</p>

<p>Although we have reason to hope that during all these
years the labours of the several persons above named were
not entirely useless, but that some persons were suitably impressed
with divine things, and lived and died under the
influence of them, contributing in some humble proportion
to preserve the worship of the true God, yet it is certain
that a Church was never formed, and that the ordinance of
the Lord's Supper was never administered, until a period to
which we are now approaching. Those who felt themselves to
be members of the invisible Church of Christ, and were desirous
of commemorating his dying love, sought the privilege in the
neighbouring Churches, as their particular views led them.</p>

<p>It was in the beginning of March, in the year 1791, that
Mr. Knight was, by the good providence of God, called to
this place; and it was now that the cause of Christ, after
experiencing many vicissitudes and serious interruptions in
its progress, was destined to enjoy a greater permanency and
regularity in the means of grace than it had ever done from
its first existence.</p>

<p>Mr. Knight was a student from the academy at Mile End.
He left the academy to come and reside amongst this people
when the cause of Christ did not present a very encouraging
appearance; and he was removed from hence to his eternal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
rest, this being the only place that enjoyed the stated labours
of that highly esteemed servant of God. He served his great
Master in this place from March, 1791, to September, 1822,
a period of more than thirty years. During his ministry the
cause of religion was considerably improved. The present
Chapel, a very compact one, capable of accommodating two
hundred and sixty persons [it has since been enlarged] was
erected in the year 1792, in a very suitable part of the village,
and near the site of the former place. Whilst it was erecting,
the service of God was performed in a spacious barn. Mr.
Knight had been here some time when his ordination took
place. The following ministers took the principal parts in the
services of that day: Mr. Grundy delivered the charge, from
Titus ii. 15, last clause; Mr. Gill preached to the people, from
2 Thessalonians iii. 16. Mr. Horsey preached in the evening,
from Acts xiii. 40. The service was highly interesting, bringing
together great numbers, being rather novel at that time
to many in this neighbourhood. After the ordination a Church
was formed, which at the beginning was small; but in the
course of Mr. Knight's ministry several were added as the fruit
of his labours. As must be expected, however, in a place circumstanced
as this is, the Church never reached to any very
great number. It has so happened, indeed, that soon after
any who promised to be a great acquisition to the Church,
and to form its brightest ornament, were joined to it, they
were removed by providence to some other place; and when
the Church has been deprived of two or three of its members
venerable for their experience, by the stroke of death, the
Church's loss being their eternal gain, the void thus made has
not been speedily made up; so that the Church has assumed
those appearances which have served alternately to raise and
depress the spirits of those who tremble for the Ark of God.
Some, indeed, of those who have been reluctantly transferred
to other Churches, remain, not only as monuments of divine
mercy and preserving grace, but as proofs of usefulness attending
the ministry of the Gospel here; and many have fallen
asleep in Christ, a part preceding and the others following him
who had been the honoured instrument of their conversion.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>Here the account closes, as written by one hand.
It appears to have been penned shortly after the death
of Mr. Knight.</p>

<p>We have some rather slight recollections of Mr.
Knight. The year preceding his own death he was
present at the funeral of the Rev. T. N. Toller, of
Kettering, when he offered a solemn suitable prayer
before the delivery of the funeral sermon by Mr. Hall.
At the half-yearly meeting of the Association, held
the next April, at Rowell, he delivered a sermon in
reference to the character and death of Mr. Toller,
from Acts xiii. 36: "After he had served his own
generation according to the will of God, he fell on
sleep." The next year Mr. Knight died, in an equally
sudden manner. In person he was robust, with a florid
countenance; his manner in the pulpit was earnest
and impressive, but laborious, strained, and sometimes
painful to the occasional hearer; his voice was powerful,
but rather harsh. A ministry faithful and persevering
left its testimony in the hearts of his people.
He was highly esteemed by his brethren, and by a
considerable circle of Christian friends.</p>

<p>For about six months from this time the pulpit was
kindly supplied by the neighbouring ministers; after
which, Mr. Nettleship, from Rotherham Academy, was
invited on probation for a month, which invitation
was renewed with a view to a final settlement; but
he declined acceding to it. After an interval of two
months, during which several students from Mr. Scott's
seminary at Rowell preached, Mr. Gibson, from Rotherham,
paid a probationary visit, and on further
invitation resided here three years, at the expiration
of which he was induced by various circumstances to
direct his attention to some other part of the vineyard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
of the Lord. This left the congregation again destitute
of a minister, and opened the way for the introduction
of Mr. Barber, who had been educated for the
ministry at Wymondley, and came here the 30th of
July, 1826. His ordination took place October 9th,
1827, on which occasion the following ministers were
engaged:&mdash;Mr. Gawthorne, of Derby, stated the nature
of a Christian Church; Mr. Scott, of Rowell,
gave the charge; Mr. Pinkerton, of Weedon, preached
to the people; Mr. Hobson, of Welford, offered the
ordination prayer. Mr. Gravestock, of Old, addressed
the congregation in the evening.</p>

<p>Mr. Barber remained the highly respected pastor of
this Christian Church until October, 1831, when, agreeably
to his own wish, he removed to go into America.
He and his wife set sail on the 20th of October.</p>

<p>The congregation was supplied two Sabbaths by
students from Rowell; and on the 23rd of the same
month in which Mr. Barber left, Mr. Islip, late pastor
of the Independent Church at Ketton, Rutlandshire,
entered on his stated labours here.</p>

<p>It was during the ministry of Mr. Barber that the
dwelling-house for the minister was rebuilt, and fitted
up in the state in which it now appears. In the spring
of the next year after Mr. Islip commenced his ministry,
the Chapel was enlarged ten feet in length, and
completed by the 8th of July. The cost of enlargement
was 110, which, with a debt remaining on the
house, was in the spring of 1837 entirely defrayed by
the united efforts of the friends.</p>

<p>Mr. Islip's ministry was attended with a good degree
of comfort and success, but was of rather short
continuance here, for, owing to the unfavourable state
of his health, he was obliged to resign his charge after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
about six years' labour in this situation. He was
succeeded by Mr. G. Nettleship, who, after labouring
thirteen years and a half in another situation in Cumberland,
accepted now the united invitation of this
Church and congregation to become their pastor. Mr.
Nettleship commenced his stated labours here on the
18th of June, 1837, and removed from Yelvertoft in
the year 1846, when he was shortly after succeeded
by the Rev. Thomas James, the present pastor of the
Church.</p>

<p>The number of Church members recorded when Mr.
Barber commenced his ministry in 1826 was twenty-one;
and five in addition appear to have been admitted
by him. About the same number we find when Mr.
Islip took the pastoral charge of this people in 1831.
On the first Sabbath in April, 1837, the minister
writes&mdash;"This closes the services and the pastorate
of Thomas Islip: twenty-eight admitted." When Mr.
Nettleship commenced his labours, there appears to
have been forty-five members in the Church; and
there were thirty added during his ministry. Since
Mr. James accepted the pastoral office, thirty-two additions
have been made to the Church; and during
his ministry new school-rooms have been erected for
the children of the Sabbath-school, at a cost of 116.
The present number of communicants is above 80.
There are 130 or 135 children attending the Sabbath-schools.</p>

<p>There is a Chapel in the village of Swinford, about
four miles from Yelvertoft, connected with this cause,
in which a regular Sabbath-evening service is conducted
by the pastor of this Church. There have been
occasional services here for some years past, and a
new Chapel was erected a few years ago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus we have seen that there has been a gradual
and pleasing advancement in this cause, giving hope of
still further tokens of the divine presence and favour;
while the pastor and his flock unitedly plead, "Let thy
work still appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto
their children."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<h3>MEMORIALS OF THE INDEPENDENT CHURCH AT
WOLLASTON.</h3>


<p>The Independent Church in the village of Wollaston
is of rather recent formation. Not more than
sixty-four years have passed since the professing Christians
residing in this place who dissented from the
Established Church were formed into a regular independent
Christian society; but in looking back to the
early days of Nonconformity, we find a Mr. Edmund
Matthews, a man of good learning, sound judgment,
and serious piety, who had been the vicar of Wollaston,
resigning the living, refusing to submit to the
terms imposed by the Act of Uniformity, coming out
from the Church, and taking his place among the noble
band of Nonconformist worthies. It was a considerable
sacrifice that he had to make, for truth and a
good conscience. "Cut off from his former means
of support, he lived privately at Wellingborough, and
practised as a medical man, but was often reduced to
great straits. When things were at the lowest, he
would commit his wife and seven children to the care
of Providence; and God mercifully appeared for them.
He was laid on the bed of affliction, and saw his end
approaching, with the prospect of leaving his family
unprovided for. There came a messenger from two of
his relations, one a draper and the other a minister,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
bidding him be easy about his wife and children, for
the one would clothe them all, and the other provide
them with food;" and to show how well they were
disposed of, it is stated "that his wife afterwards practised
medicine, and sent two of her sons to the University,
while the eldest daughter married a knight."
Mr. Matthews was a man full of compassion and genuine
charity; exemplary for faith, meekness, patience,
resignation to the will of God, and reliance on the
promises. He had great comfort in death.</p>

<p>It does not appear that Mr. Matthews made any
attempt to raise a congregation or to carry on his
ministry after his ejectment; but as there were Nonconformist
ministers who in this early period took
opportunities to preach the Gospel at Wellingborough,
which is within four miles of Wollaston, those who
separated from the Established Church in the latter
place would travel to the former to attend those services,
and would become connected with the Independent
Churches that were early formed there, while
they endeavoured to obtain occasional services in the
village where they resided.</p>

<p>It was soon after the middle of the last century that
the present Chapel was built, viz., in 1752; but it was
not until the year 1788 that the Church was formed
and the first pastor settled. In that year Mr. Perry,
of Lavendon Mill, near Olney, was invited to take
the pastoral charge over them. He was the intimate
friend and had been the fellow-labourer of Mr. Raban,
who was pastor of the Church at Yardley Hastings.
They had been connected with the Established Church
at Olney; both of them had engaged in delivering
exhortations at meetings for social prayer and for the
mutual improvement of their fellow Christians who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
belonged to the Church. These engagements were
the means of introducing them to further service, so
that they both became pastors of Independent Churches
in these villages, which were but a short distance from
their former abode.</p>

<p>In the records of the Church at West End, Wellingborough,
it is stated that "at a Church-meeting held
October 5th, 1778, Mr. Perry, of Lavendon Mill, who
had for some time before exercised his gifts among
Dissenters, though at that time in connexion with
the Church of England as by law established, having
testified his desire to join this Church with a view to
his being sent out to the ministry in an orderly way,
he came, and gave an account of his call to speak the
word, the reasons that induced him to approve of the
order of Congregational Churches, and his reasons for
desiring to join with this Church. He was proposed
to the Church to join next Church-meeting." In a
month from this time another meeting was held,
when "Mr. Perry gave in his experience to great
satisfaction, and then, according to former appointment,
preached amongst us to good satisfaction also;
and the Church being consulted, they thought it was
plainly their duty to send brother Perry out to preach
the Gospel wherever the Lord should be pleased to call
him, and concluded the next Church-meeting should
be held for that end and purpose." Then it was
unanimously agreed that brother Perry should preach
wherever Providence should call him.</p>

<p>It appears that Mr. Perry put himself into the hands
of this Church that they might judge of his qualifications
for the ministry, with a determination to submit
to the judgment they formed. In the year 1778 it is
recorded, "we dismissed brother Perry to the newly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
formed Church at Wollaston, and on May 28th he
was ordained their pastor."</p>

<p>Some time before this Mr. Perry had been preaching
at Wollaston, and when he was invited to the pastoral
office twenty-four persons had united together in the
fellowship of the Gospel. At the ordination service,
Mr. Hillyard prayed; Mr. Carver stated the nature of
the service, and proposed the usual inquiries; Mr.
Raban offered the ordination prayer; Mr. Carver gave
the charge, from Rev. ii. 10&mdash;"Be thou faithful unto
death," &amp;c.; Mr. Bull preached to the people, from Phil.
i. 27&mdash;"Only let your conversation be as it becometh
the Gospel of Christ." In the evening Mr. Greathead
prayed, and Mr. Goode preached from Psalm li. 18&mdash;"Do
good in thy good pleasure unto Zion," &amp;c.</p>

<p>Mr. Perry's ministry, after his settlement, was of
short duration, scarcely extending to five years; during
its continuance he admitted twelve members to the
small society. On February 28th, 1793, he died.
He was interred at Lavendon the Sabbath following,
when Mr. Raban preached the funeral sermon, from
1 Thessalonians ii. 8&mdash;"So, being affectionately desirous
of you," &amp;c. He was a man of a truly pious,
affectionate spirit, and was much beloved by the
little flock over which he presided.</p>

<p>Immediately after the death of Mr. Perry, another
member of the Church at Wellingborough, who had
been chosen to the office of a deacon there, but who
was resident in Wollaston, was called to take the
oversight of this infant Church. In the records of the
Church to which he belonged it is stated, under the
date of April 8th, 1793, "Brother David Hennell
exercised his gifts by expounding Scripture to the
Church in the vestry, which was very acceptable."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
October 3rd, "He was dismissed to the pastoral office,
having the united and fervent desire of his Church for
his usefulness and comfort." The friends at Wollaston
record, "immediately after the burial of our late
worthy pastor, the Lord was pleased to show us he had
seen our distress and heard our cries, for he was
disposing the mind of a dear friend of this place to the
work of the ministry&mdash;Mr. David Hennell. His gifts
were tried at Wellingborough, at the Church to which
he belonged, under Mr. Carver, and approved; they
in Christian love gave him liberty, unanimously, to
come and statedly preach amongst us. The ordination
service was held October 8th, 1794, when Mr. Raban
commenced and asked the questions; Mr. Carver delivered
the charge, from Matthew xxviii. 20&mdash;'Teaching
them to observe all things,' &amp;c.; Mr. Bull preached
to the people, from 1 Thessalonians v. 12, 13&mdash;'I beseech
you, brethren, to know them which are over you
in the Lord,' &amp;c. Mr. Hillyard, junior, preached in
the evening, from Acts xi. 23."</p>

<p>Mr. Hennell continued his services as pastor for
twenty-nine years, and during that time the place of
worship underwent some enlargement, and some additions
were gradually made to the Church, seventy-five
members being added during the course of his ministry.
At the commencement of the year 1822, owing
to advancing years and increasing infirmities, Mr.
Hennell felt it to be his duty to resign his office, which
he did on Lord's-day, January 21st.</p>

<p>Immediately after this, the attention of the people
was directed to Mr. Thomas Coleman, who was a
member of the Independent Church at Kettering, then
under the pastoral care of the Rev. T. N. Toller.
Mr. Coleman had preached at Wollaston for the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
time on the Christmas-day previous to the resignation
of Mr. Hennell, and was now invited to preach to them
on probation. This engagement was continued until
Midsummer, when he was invited to become the pastor,
and was ordained September 5th, 1822. The
following is the record preserved of the ordination
service:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Mr. West, of Harrold, read the Scriptures and prayed; Mr.
Morris, of Olney, delivered the introductory discourse and
asked the questions; Mr. Hennell, the former pastor, gave a
brief statement of the steps that had led to the formation
of the present connexion; Mr. Coleman stated the motives
which he trusted influenced him to engage in the work, the
reasons why he preferred to exercise his ministry among Dissenters,
and his views of the doctrines of the Gospel; Mr.
Jacomb, of Wellingborough, offered the ordination prayer;
Mr. Renals, of the same place, delivered the charge, from
1 Tim. iv. 16&mdash;"Take heed to thyself and to thy doctrine,"
&amp;c.; Mr. Toller, of Kettering, preached to the people, from
1 Peter ii. 2&mdash;"As new-born babes desire the sincere milk of
the word," &amp;c. Mr. Pickering, of Brigstock, preached in the
evening, from Col. i. 12&mdash;"Giving thanks unto the Father," &amp;c.</p>

<p>A Sabbath-school was first formed here after this settlement.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Hennell survived nearly eight years after the
ordination of his successor, and acted during the whole
of that period in the most kind and affectionate manner
towards him. He died July 28th, 1830. By his
request, his death was improved by his successor, from
words chosen by the preacher as appropriate to his
character and the peaceful close of his life (Luke
ii. 29): "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart
in peace, according to thy word."</p>

<p>In the year 1831 Mr. Coleman removed from Wollaston,
having received an unanimous invitation from
the Church and congregation at Ashley and Wilbarston.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
During his ministry twenty-two members had been
admitted to the Church.</p>

<p>After this, Mr. Edwards was engaged in preaching
to the people for about ten months. When he had
left them, different supplies were engaged, until, at the
commencement of the year 1834, Mr. Thomas Lord,
who was a member of the Independent Church, Castle
Hill, Northampton, was engaged as a supply. His
services proving acceptable, after a suitable time of
trial he was invited to become the pastor, and was
ordained October 24th, 1834, when Mr. Morris again
stated the nature of a Christian Church, and asked the
questions; Mr. Renals offered the ordination prayer;
Mr. Bennett, of Northampton, delivered the charge,
from 1 Tim. iv. 6&mdash;"A good minister of Jesus Christ;"
Mr. Phillips, of Harrold, preached to the people, from
Phil. ii. 1&mdash;"If there be therefore any consolation in
Christ," &amp;c. Mr. Vorley, of Charlton, preached in the
evening, from Phil. i. 27&mdash;"Only let your conversation,"
&amp;c. Mr. Lord's ministry here continued until
the year 1845, when he removed to Brigstock. During
the course of it about fifty members were added to the
Church; but ere it closed, some declensions took place.
Considerable improvements were made in the place of
worship, by its being repewed and a new vestry erected,
at a cost of about 250. A dwelling-house was also
purchased and fitted up for the minister, and made
over to the interest, by the liberality of Mr. John
Ward, of Knutson.</p>

<p>On the third Sabbath in August, 1846, Mr. John
Anderson became the pastor; but he resigned his
office in July, 1847.</p>

<p>In the year 1848, Mr. E. W. Finch, from Mr.
Frost's seminary at Cotton End, near Bedford, became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
the minister of the place; but on March 27th, 1851, Mr.
Finch resigned, and removed to Portshead, Somerset.
Fourteen members were added to the Church by Mr.
Finch.</p>

<p>In October, 1851, Mr. D. Herschell came to Wollaston,
and is at present ministering there. There
are now about forty-one members in the Church.
There are about fifty children in the Sabbath-school.
Occasional services are conducted in villages in the
vicinity.</p>

<p>Amidst various and frequent changes of late, this
interest still remains, attended with difficult circumstances.
May it be greatly revived, its numbers
increased, and its efficiency promoted!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3>MEMORIALS OF THE INDEPENDENT CHURCH AT
PETERBOROUGH.</h3>


<p>The Independent Church at Peterborough appears
to have originated in the labours of a Mr. Glascott,
a minister belonging to Lady Huntingdon's connexion,
who came to this place about the year 1776 or 1777,
to preach the Gospel of Christ. He first took his
stand under the Cross in the Market-place. He was
often interrupted in his services, and experienced much
opposition; but on some occasions there was seen the
Lady of &mdash;&mdash; Orme, Esq. standing beside him, which
proved some protection to him from the assaults of the
rude assemblage around.</p>

<p>There was also the late Mrs. Baker, who was one
of the first fruits of his ministry, who became an eminent
Christian, useful in the cause of God, regarded as
a mother in Israel, surviving to a good old age.</p>

<p>After some time they obtained a small building for
public worship, on the premises of Mr. Ashby, of
Westgate Street. At length an opportunity was presented
for building a more commodious place. Roger
Parker, Esq. was willing to let them have the piece
of ground where the Chapel now stands, for the small
sum of five guineas; but the circumstances connected
with this agreement show that to the poor emphatically
the Gospel was preached, for they were unable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
to raise the sum above specified, and were obliged,
when they met Mr. Parker at the office of the attorney
where the agreement was to be fulfilled, to inform
him privately that they could not raise the amount
required; and he put his hand into his pocket and
nobly gave them the five guineas, that they might
fulfil the contract before the attorney. The Chapel
was erected in 1779 or 1780.</p>

<p>Mr. Thresher was the first minister that was settled
over them. But such was the intolerant spirit then
prevailing in the place, that much persecution was
endured by the minister and his people. They were
frequently assailed on leaving the Chapel, pelted and
sometimes almost covered with mud and dirt. After
Mr. Thresher's ministry closed amongst them, Mr.
Woodward became the pastor. He preached every
third Sabbath at Pinchbeck, near Spalding, to which
place he subsequently removed.</p>

<p>The people had to struggle with great difficulties,
and the congregation became very low; so that at
length the Chapel was closed, and remained shut up
for about seven years. At the end of this period a
lay preacher from Northampton visited Peterborough;
and seeing the desolate state of things, he endeavoured
to collect the scattered few, and to preach the word
unto them. Application after this was made to Thos.
Wilson, Esq., who sent supplies from Hoxton Academy.
The Chapel was re-opened and stated services restored
about the year 1804.</p>

<p>The labours of Mr. Harris, one of the students from
Hoxton, proved very acceptable; he received an invitation
to become the pastor, and was ordained over
them. In his days the congregation flourished; he
became very popular, and great numbers heard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
word from his lips. Such was the interest that his
preaching excited, that the late Bishop Madan, who
manifested a liberal spirit towards Dissenters, has
been known to stand at the entrance of the Chapel,
with his hat in his hand, to hear Mr. Harris. But he
removed to Swansea about the year 1810.</p>

<p>After this, supplies were again obtained from Hoxton.
Mr. Jeanes was invited to become the pastor;
his preaching was acceptable and useful; but a few
years after he removed to Market Deeping. Mr. Cave
was another of the students who accepted an invitation
to minister here; but after a few years he removed
to Yaxley. The next minister was a Mr.
Phillips, who had been in Lady Huntingdon's connexion,
and had ministered in Zion Chapel, London.
He was pastor for a few years, and some success
attended his labours; but the people again wishing for
a change, Mr. Phillips retired in the year 1818, but
continued to reside in Peterborough, and preached
occasionally. He was at length seized with paralysis:
tried by long and heavy affliction, under which he was
very graciously sustained. He died in the year 1831.</p>

<p>Mr. J. E. Isaac was the next minister who received
an invitation to the pastoral office. The congregation
was in a very low state when he entered on his labours,
but it increased under his ministry; and after he had
laboured for three years, the Church was re-organized,
and Mr. Isaac was ordained May 22nd, 1821. On
that occasion, Mr. Jervis, of Ramsay, commenced the
service; Mr. Holmes, of Wisbeach, delivered the introductory
discourse; Mr. Morrell, of St. Neots, offered
the ordination prayer, and gave the charge; Mr.
Wright, of Stamford, preached to the people. In the
course of his ministry, Mr. Isaac had some serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
trials to contend with; but he persevered in his labours,
and they were rendered in some measure successful;
so that in the year 1832, the Chapel having
become too small for the congregation, it was thought
desirable to attempt an enlargement. This was effected,
and the place was re-opened for divine worship
in July of that year: on that occasion, Dr. Pye Smith
preached in the morning and evening, and Mr. Haynes,
of Boston, on the following Sabbath. About this time
a Sabbath-school was commenced in connexion with
the Chapel.</p>

<p>There are the names of about thirty persons recorded
"who," it is observed, "regarded Mr. Isaac as
their spiritual father." But under date of 1834 we
find the statement, that the Church saw the necessity
of a change, on account of the great decrease in the
number of hearers; so that Mr. Isaac resigned in September
of that year. Some time after this, Mr. Penman
became the minister, and was ordained February
3rd, 1836. About this period, application was made
to Earl Fitzwilliam for the grant of a piece of ground
on the south side of the Chapel, on which to build a
school-room for the use of the Sabbath-school. This
was obtained, at a rental of five shillings per annum,
on a lease of ninety-nine years. The cost of building,
with some alterations in the Chapel, was about 205.</p>

<p>During the last five years, Mr. William Palmer has
been the pastor of this Church. His labours have
been rendered very successful, in increasing the congregation
and making many additions to the Church.
Side galleries have been added to the Chapel, at a cost
of 100. There have been 120 members in Peterborough
and Yaxley added to the Church. The
Sabbath-school has increased from 60 to 200 children.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
But in the month of October, this year (1852), Mr.
Palmer was obliged to resign his charge and retire
from his labours for a season, on account of long and
severe affliction.</p>

<p>Thus another change has come over this people;
but if the spirit of the Gospel prevails amongst them,
they will receive direction from above, and God will
carry forward his designs of mercy by the ministry of
his truth and the other appointed means of his grace.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<h3>MEMORIALS OF THE INDEPENDENT CHURCH IN
TOWCESTER.</h3>


<p>In the early part of the 17th century, Mr. Samuel
Stone, one of the Puritan divines, ministered in the
Church at Towcester. He was born at Hertford, and
educated in Emanuel College, Cambridge. Having
finished his studies, he resided for some time in the
house of the excellent Mr. Richard Blackerby, where
he received useful instructions, and imbibed the spirit
and principles of his venerable tutor. Afterwards he
became minister at Towcester, in Northamptonshire,
where his superior accomplishments and great industry
were manifest to all. This, however, could not screen
him from the oppression of the times, as he was an
avowed but modest Nonconformist to the ecclesiastical
impositions. At length, seeing no prospect of enjoying
his liberty in his native country, he resolved to withdraw
from the scenes of persecution and retire to
New England, where he arrived in the year 1633, and
there he died, July 20th, 1663. It is observed, that
"Mr. Stone was a pious, learned, and judicious divine,
equally qualified for the confirmation of the truth and
the refutation of error. His ministry was attended
with the powerful demonstration and application of
the truth: his views of Church discipline were Congregational."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>The first regular services by Dissenting ministers
that are known to have been held at Towcester were
conducted chiefly by Mr. Heywood, while he was
pastor of the Church at Potterspury. He preached
for some time, every third Sabbath morning, in a
licensed house; and in the same place, a Mr. Stranger,
a Baptist minister, residing at Weston, preached occasionally.
In the year 1764, the pious people of both
denominations united to build a Meeting House for
their mutual accommodation. When Mr. Goode became
the pastor at Pury, he continued the services in
the manner of his predecessors, and his labours were
crowned with a happy degree of success. But a
change occurred, which interrupted the union which
had hitherto subsisted between those who held different
views on the subject of baptism. In 1782 a Mr.
Reddy, a Baptist minister, came to reside at Towcester,
and then the stated use of the new Meeting House
was refused to Mr. Goode and his hearers, who, in
consequence of this, met for three years after in a
private house. The attendance increasing, it was
deemed necessary to build another place of worship, in
which they were generously assisted from various quarters.
On the removal of Mr. Goode from Pury, they
obtained supplies from Newport and Hoxton Academies.</p>

<p>April 6th, 1794, the members of the Church at
Potterspury that resided in Towcester separated from
that Church for the purpose of commencing an Independent
Church here, Mr. Thomas Slattery, from
Hoxton Academy, preaching to them for the first time
on that day. On May 5th, 1794, eleven persons were
formed into a Christian Church, Mr. Hillyard, of
Olney, presiding. For some time they were supplied
by various ministers, Messrs. Bull, Greathead, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
Hillyard occasionally administering the Lord's Supper.
At length Mr. Gunn, a student from Hoxton Academy,
was invited to become the pastor, and he was ordained
October 16th, 1796. Upon this occasion Mr. Denny,
of Long Buckby, offered the ordination prayer; the
solemn engagements mutually confirmed between the
people and the minister they had chosen were introduced
by some observations on the proper tendency
and principles of such a transaction, from Mr. Greathead,
of Woburn; Mr. Bull, of Newport, gave the
charge, from Col. iv. 17; Mr. Horsey, of Northampton,
addressed the Church, from 2nd Cor. iv. 15.</p>

<p>In little more than three years after this settlement
Mr. Gunn removed to Aylesbury, and was succeeded at
Towcester by Mr. Joshua Denham, who commenced
his ministry here February 9th, 1800. Mr. Denham
continued his services as pastor until the year 1814,
when he resigned, and was succeeded by Mr. Joseph
Gravestock, from Newport Academy, who was ordained
on the 17th of August in that year, when Mr. Jackson,
of Old, began with prayer; Mr. Thomas Morrell delivered
the introductory discourse; Mr. Watson offered
the ordination prayer; Mr. Bull gave the charge, from
Ezek. iii. 17; Mr. Aston preached to the people, from
1st Thess. v. 13. Mr. Jackson preached in the evening.</p>

<p>On the death of Mr. Jackson Mr. Gravestock removed
to Old; when, after a period of four years, Mr. Hitchin
became the pastor, in July, 1818. In the year 1823
Mr. Hitchin removed to Hockliffe, and Mr. William
Hawkins, from Newport Academy, was chosen to the
pastoral office. Mr. Hawkins laboured here between
twenty and thirty years; during his ministry a new
Chapel was erected. Mr. Buckingham, minister at
Potterspury, went out from this Church.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. S. Causby, the present minister, entered on his
labours in July, 1851. The records of the Church
contain 146 names of members admitted to the Church
from its formation to the present time; but for seventeen
years, <i>i.e.</i> from 1815-1832, the book appears to
have been neglected, and no names were entered. The
number of members at this time is 50. There are 110
children in the Sabbath-schools, and 24 teachers who
take part in their instruction.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<h3>MEMORIALS OF THE INDEPENDENT CHURCH
AT OLD.</h3>


<p>In the village of Old there is a neat brick building
as an Independent Chapel, with a small burying-ground
enclosed in connexion with it; and nearly
adjoining it is a dwelling-house for the minister.
Though this Chapel was not erected until the year
1809, yet we have to look backward for a little more
than a hundred years to observe the first efforts that
were made to obtain some stated services by Nonconformist
ministers in this place. It appears highly
probable that the Gospel was occasionally preached at
Old and Scaldwell (the latter village being about a
mile from the former) in the early part of the last
century. We have found, in the records of the Independent
Church at Rowell, that there were a number
of persons who were members of that Church residing
in Scaldwell and its vicinity soon after the commencement
of the last century, who expressed a desire to be
formed into a separate Church in that place, on account
of the distance they were from Rowell; but their numbers
were thought not to be sufficient then to justify
such a step.</p>

<p>In the year 1750, Mr. Thomas Palmer, of Old,
great grandfather to the late Mr. Palmer, by deed of
bargain and sale invested certain premises at Old in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
the hands of four trustees, that out of the rents and
profits thereof they should pay 5 per annum, by
four quarterly payments, to some Dissenting minister,
teacher, or preacher, to do divine service and preach
a sermon once a month at Old for ever.</p>

<p>Neighbouring ministers performed this monthly service
for some time. The attendance on this lecture
was so good as to lead the friends to obtain more frequent
services, which were conducted in a barn on the
property. Some of the hearers were in the habit of
attending the Baptist Meeting at Walgrave, a short distance
from Old; but the practice of strict communion
cut them off from participating in divine ordinances
there, so that it was at length determined to form a
Church at Old, and to look out for a stated pastor.</p>

<p>Mr. Shadrach Jackson, from the Newport Pagnell
institution, visited Old in the year 1808, and preached
in the barn with acceptance and success. The increasing
attendance rendered it desirable and indeed
necessary to have a more suitable and commodious
place for divine worship, and the present Chapel was
erected on the premises, at a cost of 850.</p>

<p>At the ordination of Mr. Jackson, his tutor, the
late Mr. William Bull, the friend and correspondent
of Newton and Cowper, delivered an affectionate and
impressive charge, taking for his motto the remarkable
words of Joseph, addressed to his brother Benjamin
(Gen. xliii. 29): "God be gracious unto thee, my
son." The late Mr. Hillyard, of Bedford, in his own
peculiar, affectionate, and persuasive manner, gave a
most excellent address to the people, from the words of
Ruth (i. 16, 17): "Entreat me not to leave thee," &amp;c.</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson was a native of Doncaster. He early
became acquainted with Mr. Samuel Hobson, of Sheffield,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
afterwards pastor of the Church at Maldon, Beds.
The late Mr. Thorpe, of Bristol, married the sister of
Mr. Hobson, and to him both these young men were
considerably indebted for their ministerial prospects.
Both of them became students at Newport; they were
both men of ability&mdash;Hobson having perhaps most philosophy,
and Jackson most genius and pulpit unction.
The latter was a striking and impressive preacher,
decidedly popular, not failing to secure the attention
of his audience. He had an excellent gift in prayer,
and was often called upon to pray at the meetings of
his brethren in the County Association. But it was
not a long course of service that was allotted to him.
His health was not good; he was subject to an affection
of the throat; but it is thought that the affliction
which ended in death was brought on by his preaching
one night in wet clothes at the neighbouring village
of Holcott. He never ceased to feel the effects
of that night, and gradually sunk, though occasionally
giving some hopes of recovery. After a long and
painful affliction, he died, September 3rd, 1817. His
remains were interred near the pulpit, and a tablet
was erected to his memory by subscription.</p>

<p>Mr. Hillyard, minister at Bedworth, who was a
member of the Church at Old, and has supplied some
of these particulars, states&mdash;"I saw him just as he
was dying, being then about nine years of age; he
mentioned my name. Almost the last thing he said
referring to himself was, 'A sinner saved by grace.'
I well remember the deep impression his death made
on my mind; and all the circumstances of the funeral;
and the funeral sermon being preached by the late
Mr. Toller, from Acts xx. 24: 'And none of these
things move me, neither count I my life dear unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and
the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus,
to testify the Gospel of the grace of God.'" The writer
of these 'Memorials' attended that service, and has a
vivid recollection of the crowded assembly, the impressive
sermon, the solemn tones and the tears of the
preacher, with the testimony he bore to the increasing
spirituality of Mr. Jackson's mind during the closing
period of his life.</p>

<p>In the first part of Mr. Jackson's ministry the prospects
of the society were very encouraging; but it
soon became manifest that, although the Church is not
of this world, yet, being in the world, it is more or less
affected by those visitations that transpire therein, for
three very efficient friends and supporters of the cause
were soon removed by death. These events, with the
early removal of Mr. Jackson, and some dissensions
that afterwards arose, greatly weakened the cause, and
cast some gloom over its prospects.</p>

<p>The Church was now supplied by neighbouring
ministers and students until April, 1818, when Mr.
Joseph Gravestock, of Towcester, who had been a
short time fellow student with Mr. Jackson, came to
Old as a supply. As his connexion with the Church
at Towcester was dissolved, his services being acceptable
here, after a period of probation he received an
invitation to the pastoral office. On the 3rd of September,
in this year, he removed with his family to
Old; and on the evening of his arrival, preached from
Heb. xiii. 8 ("Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, to-day,
and for ever"), having special reference to the
death of his predecessor, who had been in the world
of spirits just one year, and dwelling on the immutability
and all-sufficiency of the ever living Redeemer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>"Amidst varied scenes, producing diversified fears
and hopes, Mr. Gravestock (who is still living)
pursued his ministerial course till September, 1843,
when failure of health and other circumstances induced
him to resign his office and terminate his
labours in a farewell address, from Rev. ii. 10: 'Be
thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a
crown of life.'" The stated ministry of Mr. Gravestock
at Towcester and at Old extended to nearly
thirty years, for he was ordained at the former place
August 17th, 1814, when Mr. Jackson commenced the
service with prayer; Mr. Bull, his tutor, delivering
the charge; Mr. Aston, of Buckingham, preaching to
the people; and Mr. Jackson preaching in the evening.</p>

<p>After this resignation, supplies were obtained until
1845, when Mr. Ingram Moody was invited to the
pastoral office, in which he continued until 1849, when
he resigned and emigrated to Australia.</p>

<p>After the removal of Mr. Moody, Mr. John Spence,
of Kettering, a member of the Independent Church
under the pastoral care of Mr. Toller, who had for
some time previously engaged in occasional services
in the vicinity, was invited to supply the pulpit at
Old. His ministry proving acceptable to the people,
at the expiration of four months he received an invitation
to become the pastor, and entered on his
stated labours in January, 1850, and has now become
the resident minister of the place.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1852, alterations and improvements
were made on the premises, the burying ground
enclosed, at the expense of about 60. On Lord's-day,
June 13th, three sermons were preached (morning
and evening, by Mr. Toller, of Kettering; afternoon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
by Mr. Samuel Marsh, of Moulton), when collections
were made towards the expenses incurred. Numerous
congregations assembled in the afternoon and evening.
On the following day a public tea-meeting was held,
when 200 persons took tea; after which there was
a public meeting, when Mr. J. Stockburn, of Kettering,
presided. Mr. Spence read a brief history of
the cause, when effective addresses were delivered by
several ministers and gentlemen that were present.
The collections and donations produced 36. 17<i>s.</i> 11&frac12;<i>d.</i>,
leaving a debt of 23. 2<i>s.</i> 0&frac12;<i>d.</i>, which it is hoped will
be entirely extinguished at the next anniversary, and
by means of exertions that may be made previous to
that time. The prospects of the Church appear to be
more pleasing than they have been for some years
past; and we trust that the present pastor and his
flock will go forward with united efforts and realize
an abundant blessing, peace and prosperity being
richly enjoyed among them, that the great Head of
the Church in all may be glorified.</p>

<p>In connexion with this cause at Old there is a small
place of worship at Scaldwell, where one service on
the Sabbath is generally conducted. The number of
communicants at present is twenty-six. There are
twenty-five children in the Sabbath-school&mdash;number
in minister's Bible class, thirty; and occasional services
are conducted in villages in the vicinity.</p>

<p>From this village society three Independent ministers
have been raised up, viz.: Mr. T. Hillyard, of
Bedworth; Mr. Gammage, of Ketton; and Mr. Gammage's
son, Mr. Henry Gammage, of Dunmow, Essex.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<h3>MEMORIALS OF THE INDEPENDENT CHURCH AT
EVERDON.</h3>


<p>The village of Everdon, four miles from Daventry,
contains nearly 800 inhabitants. There were no regular
efforts made here for the preaching of the Gospel
by Dissenters until the year 1811. Mr. Barge, a
member of the Independent Church at Weedon, under
the influence of compassion for the state of the inhabitants,
fitted up a small place of worship at his own
expense, measuring twenty-two feet by ten feet, which
was opened May 30th, 1811, and regularly supplied
twice on the Sabbath by Mr. Meacock, a member of
the Independent Church, West Orchard, Coventry;
and occasionally in the week by Mr. Gronow, of Weedon.
The services were well attended, and the place
was soon found to be too small for the number of
hearers; which induced Mr. Barge to give a piece of
ground for the erection of a new Chapel, which was
opened October 26th, 1813, on which occasion Mr.
Jerrard, of Coventry, preached from Rev. i. 12, 13,
and Mr. Whitehead, of Creaton, from Matt. xviii. 20,
and Mr. W. P. Davis, of Wellingborough, from Num.
x. 29. This building was invested in the hands of
trustees of the Independent denomination. Several
persons from the neighbouring villages began to attend
the services, and there was a pleasing prospect of success.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
The following spring a Church was formed by Mr.
Gronow, and Mr. Meacock was invited to become their
pastor, and was ordained on the 23rd of August, when
Messrs. Morgan, of Kilsby, Watson, of Daventry,
Gronow, of Weedon, Whitehead, of Greaton, Bicknell,
of Brownsover, Knight, of Yelvertoft, and Griffiths, of
Long Buckby, were engaged in the services of the day.
An endowment of 500 was bequeathed to the Chapel
by William Falwell, Esq., the interest of which is to
be applied toward the support of the minister for the
time being.</p>

<p>Much opposition has been experienced here, but
some have been brought to the knowledge of the truth.
The villages of Bradley, Newnham, and Farthingstone
have shared, at different periods, in the pastor's
labours; but in his later years Mr. Meacock chiefly
confined his services to Everdon. At length, through
the increasing infirmities of age, after labouring for a
period of thirty-two years amongst his little flock in
peace and harmony, he resigned the pastoral office the
first Sabbath in April, 1845, and was succeeded by
Mr. S. G. Stirmey, the present pastor.</p>

<p>Mr. Stirmey observes, that at the present time the
Church is reduced to a low state, and that the Sabbath-school
numbers but about thirty children; for great
efforts are made, and very considerable influence is
employed, on the side of the Established Church, so
that the difficulties with which this cause has to
struggle are very considerable.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<h3>MEMORIALS OF THE INDEPENDENT CHURCH AT
BRACKLEY.</h3>


<p>Brackley is a small market town and ancient borough,
near the south-west extremity of the county:
it has, in former times, been a place of considerable
importance. In the early days of Methodism, John
Wesley might have been seen sometimes, preaching to
a rustic throng from the steps of the Market-house.
But the Independent Church in this place is of very
recent date, and its history will therefore be comprised
within a very small compass.</p>

<p>A short time previous to the year 1835, "the North
Bucks Association" made an ineffectual attempt to obtain
a place of worship in this town. At length a
room was secured for the purposes of divine worship
and preaching the Gospel. This proving inadequate
to accommodate the attendants, in 1836 a Chapel was
erected, at a cost of 650, capable of seating about
300 persons. The services of Mr. John Ashby, formerly
a student at Newport, now minister at Stony
Stratford, were engaged by the newly formed congregation,
and he laboured here for somewhat more than
a year. After his removal, the pulpit was principally
supplied by students from Newport Academy. In
January, 1838, Mr. G. Smith, late of Halesworth, accepted
an invitation to labour here. In the same year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
a Church was formed, consisting of twenty persons&mdash;the
ordinance of the Lord's Supper was first administered
June 24th of that year; but in the beginning
of 1839 Mr. Smith was compelled by indisposition to
resign his connexion with the Church.</p>

<p>Again supplies were obtained from the Newport
seminary, until 1842, when Mr. W. R. Lewis commenced
a probationary course of labour, and afterwards
settled as the pastor. Under his superintendence
the Church was re-organized; but after the lapse
of three or four years circumstances arose which rendered
his removal to a more extended sphere of labour
a subject for consideration, which resulted in his resignation
about Christmas, 1846. In 1847, Mr. Robert
Davis, who had been pastor at Turvey, Bedfordshire,
accepted an invitation to minister in this place, and
continued his services until December, 1851. The
Church, again being destitute of a pastor, was supplied
for a time by ministers from the vicinity; until,
in August of this year (1852), Mr. T. Roberts, late
student at Newport Pagnell, accepted an invitation to
become the pastor under somewhat pleasing circumstances;
and it is hoped that his ministry will be rendered
truly useful, that the Church may be increased,
and the name of the Redeemer glorified. The present
number of communicants is thirty-three; children in
the Sabbath-school, rather more than fifty.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<h3>MEMORIALS OF THE INDEPENDENT CHURCH AT
BYFIELD.</h3>


<p>The village of Byfield, containing more than 1000
inhabitants, has in it a small Independent Church, of
recent origin; but it has struggled with many difficulties,
and a number of changes have taken place during
its short history, of which we can only present some
very concise statements.</p>

<p>About thirty years ago, some persons residing here,
who were members of a Dissenting Church in the vicinity,
determined to invite some of the neighbouring
ministers to preach the Gospel of Christ in this place.
For three months the services were conducted in a room,
which was rented and fitted up for the purpose. The
Home Missionary Society then agreed to give 30 as a
grant for one year, and recommended Mr. Grey as the
minister, formerly of Oakham, Rutlandshire. During
the first year of his ministry, which was 1827, a neat
little Chapel was erected. Mr. Grey remained three
years, during which time his ministry was rendered
useful. A short time after Mr. Grey had left, the
place was supplied by Mr. Kidgell, from Newport
Academy, who became the pastor of the Church in
1831. His ministry was continued here for four years.
Mr. Phillips next supplied the place for three months,
under whose ministry things greatly revived; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
through some misunderstanding, he quitted the pleasing
scene of usefulness that appeared to be opening
before him, the Church much regretting his removal.
After this Mr. Moses became the pastor, and continued
with them three years. Then a Mr. Sanderson
was invited for twelve months, in consequence of an
advertisement; "but since then," it is remarked, "the
Church has had no faith in advertising ministers." Mr.
Kidgell then returned to his former scene of labour,
and remained for eighteen months, but under considerable
discouragement. After his final removal, the congregation
was supplied by neighbouring ministers and
occasional preachers for more than twelve months.
At length they invited a Mr. Berrill, who remained
with them seven years. He laboured under many difficulties,
weathered many storms, and at length retired
from the situation. For ten months they remained
destitute, having supplies as they could be obtained.
In March, 1849, their present minister, Mr. Robson,
came to supply them, and was invited to remain. He
found the place in a very low state, but things have
taken a favourable turn. The Chapel is now well attended,
and seventeen members have been added to the
Church. The present number of communicants is
thirty-three. In the Sabbath-school there are thirty
children, instructed by six teachers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<h3>MEMORIALS OF THE INDEPENDENT CHURCH AT
PAULERSPURY.</h3>


<p>In this village, known as the birth-place of the celebrated
Dr. Carey, of the Baptist Mission at Serampore,
the Independent Church is of recent formation. In
the year 1826 a Chapel was erected, and the whole of
the expenses were cleared off by the exertions of Mr. Hawkins,
Independent minister, of Towcester. About
the autumn of 1841, Mr. Buckingham, the present
minister of this place, was invited to preach in the
Chapel on the week evenings. His services proving
acceptable, attention being excited, and indications of
usefulness appearing, the congregation expressed a desire
to enjoy the benefit of his stated labours. In connexion
with this proposal, arrangements were made
between the congregation at Paulerspury and the
Church at Towcester, for the Chapel, then the property
of that Church, to be put in trust for the use of
this congregation. In the summer of 1842 Mr. Buckingham
began to labour statedly among the people,
and was much encouraged by the increasing attention,
and the disposition manifested by the people to hear
the word. A Sabbath-school was formed, when between
forty and fifty children attended: it had a gradual
increase, until, in the following year, the number of
scholars rose to 200. Since then the numbers have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
varied, owing to different causes which will arise in
this changing world. The congregation increased so,
that it was found necessary to erect two side galleries,
in addition to the front gallery that had been
already formed. The week-day services were also well
attended. A small number of persons, most of whom
had been brought to an acquaintance with divine
things under Mr. Buckingham's ministry, were desirous
of enjoying the benefits of Church fellowship, and
were encouraged to give themselves to the Lord and to
each other in these bonds of the Gospel; and were accordingly
formed into a Church, consisting of sixteen
members, on the 28th of February, 1844. The services
on the interesting occasion were conducted by
Messrs Hawkins, of Towcester; Slye, of Potterspury;
J. Bull, of Newport Pagnell; and Wager, of Stony
Stratford: then the ordinance of the Lord's Supper
was first administered to them, in which persons of
different religious denominations united, who appeared
to feel a deep and lively interest in the solemnity.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the year 1845 some of the
members of the Church experienced much persecution,
which caused a few to halt, and others to keep back.
It rose to such a height, at one time, as to threaten the
extinction of the rising energies of the Church; but
through the kind interposition of a gracious Providence,
a reaction took place, and the wrath of man
was made to praise God.</p>

<p>In the early part of the year 1847, the subject of
Mr. Buckingham's ordination was mentioned; neighbouring
ministers having hitherto administered the
Lord's Supper. After much deliberation and prayer,
the subject was laid before the ministers of the North
Bucks Association, and after mature consideration
the approval of their committee was expressed. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
was arranged that the ordination service should take
place on the 24th of November, 1847. On that day,
Mr. Hawkins commenced the services; Mr. J. Bull expounded
the principles of Congregationalism in an introductory
discourse; Mr. Slye proposed the questions;
Mr. Davis offered the ordination prayer; Mr. T. P. Bull
gave the charge; Mr. Aston preached to the people.</p>

<p>The year immediately succeeding this, Mr. Buckingham's
health began very seriously to fail, and he was
obliged to desist from preaching for several months,
during which time supplies were obtained. His
health is still very delicate, and but for frequent assistance
he would be obliged to resign the pastoral
oversight of his much attached people.</p>

<p>In consequence of the large number of school
children, it was deemed advisable to erect new school-rooms
for their better accommodation. In the year
1850 the school-rooms were erected, at a cost of 150.
Through the kindness of friends, and especially the
friends at Pury, the whole is now cleared off. A
burial ground is attached to the Chapel, and more
than fifty interments have taken place since it was
appropriated for this purpose in 1843.</p>

<p>In regard to the future, the pastor observes "that
the prospects are very cheering." On the Sabbath
and week-evening services the attendance continues
steady and regular, and never better than at the present
time. The Church has continued to increase.
The present number of communicants is seventy-two;
Sabbath-school children, one hundred and fifty-nine&mdash;teachers,
forty.</p>

<p>We trust the blessing of the Lord will still rest
upon them, and that, "walking together in the fear of
the Lord, and the comfort of the Holy Ghost, they
will be edified and multiplied."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<h3>HOME MISSIONARY STATIONS.</h3>


<h4>1.&mdash;KING'S CLIFFE AND NASSINGTON.</h4>

<p>In the north-eastern part of the county of Northampton
there are two Home Missionary Stations. In
the first of these the agent statedly preaches at King's
Cliffe and Nassington, having a Chapel at Castor also
under his superintendence.</p>

<p>The Church that has been formed at King's Cliffe
originated in the efforts of the General Baptists about
thirty years back. The Rev. Mr. Payne, who belonged
to that denomination, and was minister of Baradon,
Rutlandshire, preached the Gospel here, and had a
Chapel erected. But Mr. Payne shortly after left
the neighbourhood; and after repeated efforts by
Baptist ministers, with but little success, the place
was resigned into the hands of the Independents.</p>

<p>The Northamptonshire Association of Independent
Churches took the place under their direction for a
time, in connexion with Nassington, and the Rev.
J. Matthews and the Rev. J. Dann laboured in these
places, having their residence chiefly at the latter
village. A Church was formed at Nassington on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
8th of April, 1835; and the present Chapel was
opened for public worship on the 21st of May, 1839,
when the Rev. B. Hobson, of Welford, and the Rev.
E. T. Prust, of Northampton, preached.</p>

<p>In the year 1841 the station was taken into connexion
with the Home Missionary Society. In
March, 1844, the Rev. G. Amos, one of the Society's
agents, was sent on probation, and accepted as the
minister of the two Churches. On the 24th of June
in that year his ordination took place, in the Chapel
at Nassington: the ministers who engaged were the
Rev. Messrs. Islip, of Stamford, Gammage, of Ketton,
Goode, of Peterborough, Newth, of Oundle, Smith, of
Wymondham. In October of that year Mr. Amos
commenced his residence at King's Cliffe.</p>

<p>The ground on which the Chapel was first erected
here being private property, and as no satisfactory
arrangements for its purchase could be made, it was at
length determined to give it up, and to build a new
one. The present Independent Chapel in King's
Cliffe was built in the year 1846; the opening
services were held on the 29th of September. The
Rev. J. Richardson, of Tottenham Court Chapel,
London, preached two sermons on the occasion; and
on the following Sabbath sermons were preached by
the Rev. J. Matthews, of Shepton, Norfolk, the Rev.
A. Newth, of Oundle, and the Rev. W. Robinson, of
Kettering. A school-room was built in 1847, and
opened for a Day-school in October of that year. The
cost of the Chapel and the school-room was about
500. Of this sum, there now remains a debt of
about 150. At Castor a neat Chapel was erected in
1848; the Rev. T. Toller, of Kettering, and the Rev.
E. T. Prust, of Northampton, preached when it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
opened for divine worship. There are thirty-seven
members in the Church at King's Cliffe, and forty
in the Church at Nassington&mdash;total, seventy-seven.
The Sabbath-school in the former place has one
hundred and thirty children, and the Sabbath-school
in the latter place, seventy&mdash;total, two hundred.</p>


<h4>2.&mdash;BOROUGH FEN.</h4>

<p>This place is extra parochial, the property of Sir
Culling Eardley Eardley, Bart., situated six miles
north of Peterborough. The Gospel was introduced
here about twenty years ago, by the Wesleyan
Methodists; the preaching services were then conducted
in a room of the house now occupied by the
minister. In 1836 Sir Culling built a neat and spacious
building, which is used both as a daily school-room
and Chapel. For several years the preaching
services were conducted by the master. A congregation
having been thus collected, and Sunday-schools
opened, it was considered to be a promising sphere for
regular ministerial labour; and accordingly, in 1843,
Mr. D. Blellock was stationed here as a Home Missionary.
After the removal of Mr. Blellock in 1846,
Mr. Alexander Yuill was settled here, who, after a
few months of acceptable and useful labour, fell asleep
in Jesus. In January, 1849, Mr. J. B. Bishop, the
present pastor, was invited to settle over the congregation
worshipping in this place and in Peakirk.
Through Mr. Bishop's instrumentality a Christian
Church was formed, March 30th, 1849, numbering
thirteen members. The following places are connected
with this station, viz.: Peakirk, Crowland (Lincolnshire),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
Glinton, and New Borough. There are now
twenty-seven Church members, seventy-five Sabbath-school
children, and one Day-school.</p>


<h4>3.&mdash;MIDDLETON.</h4>

<p>In the year 1844, a neat and commodious village
Chapel, capable of seating near two hundred hearers,
was erected here, at a cost of more than 300; and
this year (1852) school-rooms have been added, which
have cost nearly 100. It is supplied generally in
the afternoon and evening of the Sabbath, and there
is in connexion with it a Sabbath-school containing
nearly one hundred children.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

PROVIDENT SOCIETY.</h3>


<p>There is a Society in connexion with the Independent
Churches, bearing the title of "The Provident Society for the
Relief of Aged and Afflicted Ministers and their Families in
the County of Northampton and its Connexions."</p>

<p>This Society was established in the year 1811: its funds at
the present time amount to about 6,400, and they are
receiving a small increase by annual collections and subscriptions,
the interest of the funds being applied to the relief of
the claimants.</p>

<p>In the year 1817, about six years after its establishment,
the first claims were made; since that time, the sum of nearly
5,000 has been distributed to ministers and to the families
of ministers who were members. The importance of this
Society is amply proved by the extent of relief that claimants
have received from its funds. Its management is conducted
entirely free of expense, and it will be capable of rendering
efficient aid to all its members who, in accordance with its
rules, present their case for assistance at the annual meetings
of its members.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span></p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>The following list contains the names of the villages in
the County that are supplied with Sabbath evening services,
chiefly by the Independent Churches. Some of the villages
have an afternoon service on the Sabbath, and some of them
an occasional service on a week evening. The list is not to
be regarded as quite complete. In some instances, the Independents
unite with other denominations in supplying the
villages in their vicinity.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
